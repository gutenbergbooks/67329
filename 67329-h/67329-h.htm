<p>The completion of this book has been retarded by circumstances
unforeseen in the winter of 1914, when I collected
most of its materials. I have not, since then, had
any opportunity of visiting England, and have thus been
unable to augment and verify these materials&mdash;which
must account for what incompleteness and inaccuracy
there may be found in the text as well as in the notes. For
the same reason I have been compelled strictly to limit
the range of my study, and to desist from all inquiry into
Maturin’s influence on the romantic movement in France.
Neither can my account of his connection with English
literature of the latter part of the 19:th century lay any
claim to completeness, being confined only to some of the
most obvious instances. The fact, however, of this influence’s
having been greater than is, perhaps, generally known,
would seem to justify the publication of a study of Maturin’s
own works exclusively. These, apart from the intrinsic
merit of the best of them, possess, moreover, the interest
of being extremely characteristic of, I think, a most fascinating
period in the history of literature. It will possibly be
remarked that those of them whose literary value is certainly
not important, are, in my study, reviewed at rather
unnecessary length; but as they have long ago disappeared,
not only from the market but also from most libraries,
the reader who may take an interest in some of the ideas
which they reflect and which are so unfamiliar to our own
times, has very few opportunities to become acquainted
with the books themselves.</p>

<p>During the course of my work I have received kind assistance
from many quarters, which it is my agreeable duty
here to acknowledge. For much valuable advice my gratitude
is due to Mr. D. J. O’Donoghue, of University College,
Dublin, who was the first to encourage me to set
about a study of Maturin, and to Professor Yrjö Hirn, of
Helsingfors, who has, with a never-failing interest, followed
my work from its beginning. For unpublished biographical
material I am under obligation to Mr. John Murray, for
having permitted me to make use of Maturin’s letters to
John Murray, the publisher; and to Miss Ella Hepworth
Dixon, who has placed Maturin’s correspondence with
Sir Charles and Lady Morgan at my disposal. I must also
mention that Mr. More Adey has favoured me with the loan
of such of Maturin’s works as I do not possess, without
which kindness the completion of my study would have
been utterly impossible. Lastly, it remains to offer my
best thanks to Mr. S. Sydney Silverman for help rendered
me in point of language, the book being written in what
is to me an acquired tongue.</p>

<p>In the history of literature change means liberation. The
intellectual aspect of a period having worn itself out, the
forms which have supported it are felt to be a clog and a
burden; and when these forms are dissolved, the channel
of thought, from a natural sense of freedom, takes a course
diametrically opposite. The transformation seldom takes
place abruptly; it may even have been long prepared by
pioneers more or less conscious of the advance of a new
time with new ideals; but the greatest as well as the most
characteristic productions of the victorious movement are
not brought forth until the previous order of things has
been completely overthrown, and sometimes there is but
a short step from the zenith of a literary current to its
decadence.</p>

<p>Romanticism in England represented a reaction against
that traditional 18:th century, into which Cowper, and
Bums, and Ossian had already brought elements new and
resuscitating, and whose foundations had at a still earlier
date been gently stirred by Thomson, Collins, and Gray.
It was a reaction against a time when poetry, although
of a polish unequalled afterwards, was confined to subjects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
upon which the expending of exalted emotions was
impossible; when fiction chiefly comprised moralizing descriptions
pertaining to everyday life; and when all sense
of outward nature was excluded from both. In the English
literature of the beginning of the 19:th century the
terms romanticism and naturalism&mdash;in curious opposition
to the subsequent use of the words&mdash;represented collateral
currents, springing from the same source, and sometimes
the terms were nearly synonymous. In their very
essence both of these terms implied a greater amount of
freedom. Return to nature was one of the leading catchwords
of the time; and the intention of seeing nature not
only visually, but also in its most intimate connections
with human life, and as intervening in the destinies of man,
was to contribute a new depth to thought and feeling, as
well as to render the emotions more varied and more intense.
The lays of by-gone ages and primitive peoples were studied
with admiration and received as wisdom. This interest
in nature, independent as it was of any limits of time
and space, was followed by the revival of imagination,
upon which faculty the romantic movement was largely
based. In order to gain a freer scope for imagination
romanticism took its literary models and ideas from the
dim and mysterious middle ages rather than from the
clear and well-regulated classical; in the contrast between
the Gothic and the Antique the ‘barbarities’ of the
former receded to the background, according as its greater
suitability to ‘the views of a genius and to the ends of
poetry’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> became apparent. But in this approach of the
mind to nature there was an underlying sense of the incapacity
of human conditions to impart happiness, and the
flight of imagination to vague and unknown regions was
prompted by the feeling that in reality there was no consolation.
It was, consequently, not with unalloyed delight
that the romantic mind turned to new and untilled fields.
It is a characteristic of the movement that it begot a melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of its own, a nervous, restless kind of melancholy,
connected with temporal rather than eternal matters, and
foreign to its predecessors in the previous century; the
difference from these is made apparent upon comparing
the melancholy of <i>Childe Harold</i> to that of the <i>Night
Thoughts</i>. If it were possible to imagine the Renaissance
with its gaiety turned into <i>Weltschmerz</i>, the result would
be something like the romanticism of the early 19:th
century.</p>

<p>However, freedom held sway, if not in life, still in literature,
and the English romanticism owed its masterpieces
to originality, as the English classicism did to imitation.
Another consequence of this freedom was a greater variety
in the romantic literature. <i>Tintern Abbey</i> and <i>The Ancient
Mariner</i> were both written about the same time; both
are original and entirely different, and both would have
been inconceivable in 1750.</p>

<p>The liberation of the imaginative mind evidently had
its perils. Among the romantic writers&mdash;even among
those of rank&mdash;were men to whom freedom implied excess
and whose originality was not always strong enough to
supply the breakdown of rules and restrictions, and who,
accordingly, have not escaped oblivion. One of these is
Charles Robert Maturin, the subject of the following pages:
a man of unmistakable genius, who was not without influence
on some of his happier contemporaries; in whose works
the main currents of the time are faithfully and variously
reflected, and who occasionally gives forcible proofs of his
creativeness in passages that point to the standards of
much later periods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The family of Maturin come from France. The ancestor,
Gabriel Maturin, was a Huguenot priest to whom life in
that country was made impossible and who, after various
adventures, settled in Ireland towards the close of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
17:th century. Concerning this ancestor there was a family
tradition, duly recorded in all the biographies of Charles
Robert Maturin, with the statement that it had, from his
childhood, made an indelible impression upon him and
that he firmly believed it to be true; or with the suggestion
that he had invented it himself in some romantic fit or
other. The mystery connected with the birth of his ancestor
is usually represented as the principal charm Maturin
found in the story, yet if related in his own words<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it is
patent to all which point of the narrative is most strongly
emphasized. Many of the most characteristic passages in
Maturin’s writings can be explained by the fact that he
was fond of imagining his own family to have been a victim
of religious persecution. This is how he used to tell the
legend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the reign of Louis XIV the carriage of a catholic lady of
rank was stopped by the driver discovering that a child was lying
in the street. The lady brought him home, and, as he was never
claimed, considered and treated him as her child: he was richly
drest, but no trace was furnished, by himself or otherwise, that
could lead to the discovery of his parents or connexions.</p>

<p>As the lady was a devotee, she brought him up a strict catholic,
and being puzzled for a name for him, she borrowed one from a
religious community, <i>les Maturins</i>, of whom there is mention in
the Jewish Spy, and who were then of sufficient importance to give
their name to a street in Paris, <i>la Rue des Mathurins</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of all the good lady’s pains, and maugre his <i>nom de
caresse</i>, my ancestor was perverse enough to turn protestant, and
became pastor to a hugonot congregation in Paris, where he sojourned,
and begat two sons.</p>

<p>While he was amusing himself in this manner, the king and
<i>père</i> La Chaise were amusing themselves with exterminating the
protestants; and about the time of the revocation of the edict of
Nantz, Maturin was shut up in the bastile, where he was left for
twenty six years; I suppose to give him time to reflect on the
controverted points, and make up his mind at leisure.</p>

<p>With all these advantages he continued quite untractable:
so that the catholics, finding the case desperate, gave him his
liberty.</p>

<p>There was no danger, however, of his abusing this indulgence:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
for, owing to the keeper forgetting accidentally to bring him fuel,
during the winters of his confinement, and a few other <i>agremens</i>
of his situation, the poor man lost the use of his limbs, and was a
cripple for life.</p>

<p>He accompanied some of his former flock, who had been grievously
scattered, to Ireland, and there unexpectedly found Madame
M&mdash;&mdash; and his two sons, who had made their escape there <i>via</i> Holland.</p>
</div>

<p>The descendants of Gabriel Maturin remained in the
service of the church for which he is alleged to have suffered.
His son Pierre is mentioned in 1699<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as ‘chapelin du regiment
du Marquis de Pisar’ at the French congregation of St. Patrick
and St. Mary in Dublin; afterwards he became dean
of Killala. One of Pierre Maturin’s sons, Gabriel James,
held the deanery of Kildare and, after Swift, that of
St. Patrick’s.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He died in 1746, leaving at least one son&mdash;William,
the poet’s father&mdash;who renounced the clerical
career and became an official in government service. After
entering the Post Office he was appointed Clerc of the
Munster Road. The re-organization of the Post Office
by the Irish parliament<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> apparently made the situation
lucrative, for during the two last decades of the century
William Maturin was a wealthy and respected man in
Dublin, and took active part in the public life of the town.
He married Miss Fidelia Watson, who presented him with
six children; of these Charles Robert was born in 1780.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
William Maturin was a man of refinement and was interested
in literature, so much so, that he is recorded<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to
have had some intentions, in early life, of devoting himself
to that profession, but for the death of an illustrious
personage to whose patronage he had looked forward.
The time of literary protection, in the old sense, was, indeed,
past and gone, and if his son also had been dependent on
it, the name would have been lost to literature. Maturin
senior was, however, a man in whose house literary inclinations
were cherished and encouraged, and the youthful
lyrics which his son poured forth at an early age, are said
to have had a wide circulation among friends and relations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
sometimes even finding their way into the local papers.
In every respect the childhood of Charles Robert seems
to have been bright and happy. He was, no doubt, an
amiable child, though spoilt on account of his delicate
health and looked up to for his cleverness. His favourite
pastimes, as those of so many future dramatists, were
juvenile theatricals, and in these he was allowed freely to
indulge; again and again the drawing-room was turned
into a stage, the wardrobes were robbed of what was thought
fit, and an occasional piece from Charles Robert’s own
pen was acted, or else some old play&mdash;Lee’s <i>Alexander</i>
for preference, where he always played the principal part
with wild impetuosity, to the delight and wonder of his
sisters and an admiring circle of companions.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The poets
to whom his taste first drew him were the dramatists of
the Restoration, a period which always interested him
keenly. For Lee, Southerne, and Otway his partiality prevailed
even in later years, and he never admitted them inferior
to any but Shakespeare and the foremost Elizabethans.
Once, when praising Otway’s <i>Venice Preserved</i>, he is said<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
to have added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I speak, perhaps, from an old feeling of attachment, but, nevertheless,
from deep conviction. The earliest associations of my mind
are with Pierre and Jaffier at the Rialto at midnight: I still fancy
I hear the sullen moan of the waters below me, and that I am standing
on that lofty bridge beside the glorious conspirators; I could
surrender almost any early impressions in preference.</p>
</div>

<p>In the field of fiction Maturin’s early impressions were
equally powerful, but here his taste was fixed and decided
by productions of his own time, such as saw the light in
his growing years. The Gothic Romance, or school of
terror, which is usually considered to have begun with
Walpole’s <i>Castle of Otranto</i> in 1764, had in the nineties
an extraordinary flight. All the romances of Mrs Radcliffe,
Lewis’s <i>Monk</i> and Godwin’s <i>St. Leon</i>, with a host of imitations,
followed each other in rapid succession and actually
became, for a short time, the rage of the public; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
among the younger generation who listened to these sombre
and mysterious story-tellers, one of the most enthusiastic
listeners was the Irish boy who was, but too late, to become
the greatest of them himself. Of the merits of the novel
of terror Maturin afterwards made the following recognition:<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a medium of excitement or impression, it (terror) was certainly
the most powerful that could be used by one human being
on another, from the clown who dresses up a figure to frighten his
fellow into idiotism or madness, to the romance-writer who rings
bells by viewless hands, encrusts daggers with long-shed blood,
conceals treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry,
or sends mad nuns or their apparitions to wander about the gardens
of their convents.</p>
</div>

<p>From this selfsame medium of excitement Maturin’s
own works never became wholly free; and even when
applying criticism to the writers that were the delight
of his youth, he cannot but speak of them in a tone of
admiration, strongly contrasted with the marked aversion
with which he mentions Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>These, then, were the literary auspices under which
Charles Robert Maturin grew up.&mdash;After attending the
school of one Mr. Kerr, he entered Trinity College, as a
Pensioner, in November 1795; some years later he obtained
a scholarship, and finally a bachelor’s degree. His
intentions regarding the profession of an actor were probably
definitely abandoned by this time, and theology
became the main subject of his studies. According to
biographers, Maturin’s university career was successful and
even brilliant, although a certain indolence and eccentricity
was always noticeable in his habits. He acquired
distinctions both as a classical scholar and an active member
of the theological class, and in the once famous Historical
Society he is also said to have distinguished himself by
‘rhetorical and poetical productions.’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Historical
Society, afterwards abolished by the government, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
founded the year previous to Maturin’s entrance at College,
and was a fruit of the vivid intellectual activity ruling in
every department during the short period of Irish independence.
The time in which Maturin lived, it is important
to note, was the most remarkable in the political history
of Ireland. In 1782 Grattan had had the satisfaction of
hailing Ireland as a nation; the parliament in College
Green began its work of reforms with a joyous sense of
reconciliation with England, and a general hope that it
would last for ever. Dublin became, for a time, one of
the liveliest capitals in Europe, and the meeting-place
of the greatest wits and most eloquent men of the kingdom.
The generation, however, which was born with the
Irish parliament, had not reached their manhood ere calamities
loomed ahead again. They saw the rebellion of
’98 with all its horrors; they also lived to see the Union
and felt the oppressive calm that followed in its wake,
interrupted only by the unfortunate insurrection of Emmet
in 1803. The works of Maturin demonstrate sufficiently
that he was an ardent Irish nationalist who resented the
Union; but he was, by temperament, nothing of a politician,
and none of the family seem to have been involved in
any political intrigues. There was, however, another side
of nationalism&mdash;closely connected with the romantic
movement in all countries&mdash;which he eagerly embraced.
It expressed itself in an interest in the folklore, antiquities
and early history of Ireland, preferably seen in a slightly
romantic colour. The <i>Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards</i>
of Joseph Cooper Walker, which was long considered a
standard work in its subject, appeared in 1786, giving rise
to other investigations of the same kind. Among Irish
novelists Maturin and Lady Morgan were those in whose
(earlier) writings this sense of a glorious past first found
expression, besides which their works also, for the first
time in fiction, aimed at a conscious and artistic description
of genuine Irish scenery. Maturin’s sense of nature was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
ever on the alert, and the beautiful Wicklow mountains
were to him, as to so many other Irish writers of later
times, a constant source of poetic inspiration.</p>

<p>As for life and circumstances in general, towards the
end of the 18th century, they were indeed ‘wild, wonderful,
and savage,’ to use a critic’s words of Maturin’s <i>Women</i>
in its quality of an Irish story. Reality abounded in startling
and extraordinary incidents, not seldom outdoing even
the confessedly fertile imagination of the poets of Erin.
The picture which Miss Edgeworth drew, in her immortal
<i>Castle Rackrent</i> (1800) of a typical Irish estate, other writers
confirmed to be eminently faithful; life in the country,
all around, was feudal, wild and reckless; elopements
occurred frequently, and duels were daily bread among
the gentry. The disposition of the lower classes was likewise
all for the adventurous, so much so that the autobiography
of a famous highwayman became one of the
most popular schoolbooks, effects of which reading by no
means failed to make an appearance.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In the capital the
social contrasts presented themselves at their sharpest.
Beside the refined, gay and brilliant Dublin there was
another, where the sullen murmur of discontent was never
hushed, and which was constantly hovering on the brink
of rebellion. ‘There existed,’ says Carleton,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> ‘in Dublin
two distinct worlds, each as ignorant of the other&mdash;at
least, in a particular point of view, and during certain
portions of the day&mdash;as if they did not inhabit the same
country.’ Fierce street-frays occasionally raged for whole
days in public thoroughfares, and the students of Trinity
College were said to be particularly prone to take part
in these and other such-like amusements.&mdash;</p>

<p>What other records there are left of the youthful years
of Maturin are centred in the story of a courtship which
ended in marriage at an early age. The object of his
attachment was Miss Henrietta Kingsbury, like himself
of an old and respected Protestant family. According to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
a tradition it was Miss Kingbury’s grandfather to whom
Swift is supposed to have uttered his last words before
the light of his powerful mind was darkened for ever.
A brother of hers was archdeacon of Killala. Now biographers<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
generally maintain that Maturin married while
still going through his college course, and decided in favour
of the clerical profession <i>after</i> his marriage, in hopes of
being promoted through the interest of his wife’s relations;
but this, at least partly, seems to be wrong. Maturin was
not exactly a child at the time of his marriage&mdash;he was
23 years old&mdash;; he had most probably finished his college
course and had certainly taken holy orders, being already
in enjoyment of the title Reverend, as may be seen from
his marriage license at the Public Record Office in Dublin<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>The union proved happy. Though the maintenance of
a growing family early compelled Maturin to strenuous
work, his literary occupations being thus influenced by
pecuniary considerations, it at the same time gave him
full compensation for his labours. His wife was a woman
of beauty and talents&mdash;she was one of the best singers
in Dublin, a pupil of Madame Catalani&mdash;and the conjugal
harmony is said never to have been broken. In many of
his works Maturin speaks of a happy home with nothing
short of devotion, and in one of his sermons he calls domestic
felicity ‘the best, the only that deserves the name,
the sole flower that has been borne unwithered from paradise.’
Yet it was, no doubt, well for the domestic felicity
that Mrs Maturin <i>was</i> a woman of elegance and possessed
talents admired in society; for her husband was not always
content with a quiet home-life but would, from time to
time, emerge from it to be a lion of reception-rooms and
to play the part of a dandy and a <i>grand seigneur</i>. His
was a complicated nature, and there was&mdash;though certainly
much exaggerated by tradition&mdash;another side of
his character, vain, pleasure-loving and extravagant, which
broke out, as will be seen, with singular force after his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
only great success in life.&mdash;As for Maturin’s choice of
profession, it must be considered a failure. Not that he
lacked qualifications for his calling: he was naturally religious,
and distinguished himself as a very eloquent preacher,
nor was he ever accused of neglect in the discharge of his
duties; but the ‘worldly’ side of his character was too
strong not to bring about conflicts. The union of clergyman
and author was, after the classical examples of Swift
and Sterne, probably not in itself an abomination in the
eyes of the British public. Yet the apparent incompatibility
of the two in Maturin’s case was continually emphasized
by hostile critics, and his eccentric habits, his
connection with the theatre and his excessive fondness for
dancing was more than the average mind could ever understand
in one of his profession; to judge from certain utterances<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Maturin was, at least in the most rigorous-minded
circles, actually considered more or less insane.&mdash;</p>

<p>What induced Maturin to choose a profession in the earliest
years of the century was, besides his intention of marrying,
the declining state of his father’s affairs. About the time of
the Union the work of the postal establishment appears
to have fallen into a decay, which sadly affected the Clerks
of the Roads, who were paid in proportion to the frequency
and quantity of their sendings. As early as 1802 Mr. William
Maturin is found writing<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to the secretary of the
Irish Post Office to complain of the distressing diminution
of his income. After drawing a comparison with the extent
of his sendings in previous years, he continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Under these embarrassing Circumstances, already deprived of
the principal part of my subsistence, and with the melancholy
prospect of the rapid failure of the residue, I earnestly supplicate
you, Sir, to lay this application before the Post Masters General,
whose humanity I trust will not permit an old and faithful servant,
to be reduced, without any fault on his part, from a state of humble
competence, to wear out the short remains of his Life in penury
and distress.</p>

<p>Yet this must be the case, if Government do not graciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
interpose, by granting not only some Compensation for past losses,
but some provision against those exigencies which are encreasing
every hour, and threaten the total extinction of the emoluments
of a Clerc of the Road-Emoluments, which after a service of 40
years, are almost all the provision left us.</p>
</div>

<p>This application was forwarded with the secretary’s
recommendations, but whether it had any effect is uncertain.
At all events it is clear that the family was not
quite abruptly plunged from affluence into poverty at the
final dismissal of Maturin senior from his situation&mdash;of
which more later on&mdash;and that his son had long before
been obliged to work hard both as a curate and an author.
His first appointment was the curacy of Loughrea, to
which he attended some time between 1804 and 1806.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The sojourn of Maturin in Loughrea was, upon the whole,
felt as a kind of exile; wretched place as a small Irish
country-town at that time must have appeared to all,
it was intolerable to a man of literary interests and social
habits. His dreariness was, however, pleasantly interrupted
by his sojourn as a guest at Cloghan Castle, the seat
of the family of O’Moore, who were supposed to be the
lineal descendants of the old kings of Leix. In a note to
<i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> Maturin says that he was an inmate
of the castle for many months, and to his friends he used
to speak with delight of ‘that ancient structure, and the
Irish hospitality he there enjoyed and witnessed.’<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> For
Maturin’s literary conceptions this visit was of importance.
He saw now, for the first and only time in his life, a glimpse
of the wild nature of Western Ireland; he actually inhabited,
himself, one of those old castles the occurrence of
which in the romantic productions of the period was a
<i>conditio sine qua non</i>; and he came into contact with
genuine types of Irish peasantry, such as he was afterwards
to describe with an impartiality and a graphic realism
unequalled in earlier Irish fiction.</p>

<p>Through some exertion on the part of his relations,
Maturin was before long removed to the curacy of St. Peter’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
in Dublin, where he remained to the hour of his death.
The parish was one of the most extensive in the town,
and was said to contain ‘most of the wealth, rank, and
talent of the metropolis.’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The salary of the curate, however,
did not amount to more than 80-90 pounds per
annum, and Maturin was, consequently, forced to eke out
this slender income by other means. Alaric Watts says
in his article that Maturin resided in his father’s house
until the final economic ruin of that gentleman; according
to other writers he established himself, immediately
on his return to Dublin, in York Street,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> where he set
up a kind of boarding school and prepared young men
for College. The task was rather congenial to him; he
was always fond of the company of very young people,
and at his well-known house, alternately the scene of luxury
and poverty, he was wont to arrange private theatricals
and other amusements with his pupils. York Street was
then very different from what it is now, belonging to the
fashionable Dublin, round Stephen’s Green.</p>

<p>By this time, also, Maturin’s first romance was composed.
He wrote for money, it is true; but he turned
to this mode of gaining&mdash;or trying to gain&mdash;money,
because literature represented his greatest interest in life.
Few authors, in fact&mdash;whatever Maturin himself may
say in the prefaces to his books&mdash;have felt themselves
to be literary men so intensely as Maturin. If he had been
a rich man, he would certainly have been an author all
the same, as were Beckford and Lewis. As for his first
book, it was conceived from his own innermost inclinations.
<i>The Fatal Revenge; or, The Family of Montorio</i> was written
in the Radcliffe style, not because Maturin believed it to
be the style best relished by the general public, but because
he, at the time in question, relished it best himself.</p>

<p>It was, however, not without secret apprehension Maturin
went forth to realize his literary aspirations. The
unfortunate conflict between his bent and his profession&mdash;as
understood by the multitude&mdash;asserted itself at the
very beginning of his career; ‘Maturin’s friends,’ as a biographer<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
puts it, ‘being a little evangelical, he could not
risk offending or scandalizing them by appearing publicly
as a writer of novels.’ He was, accordingly, compelled to
choose a pseudonym, and lighted upon the rather unhappy
one of Dennis Jasper Murphy. So, at least, it was judged
afterwards by those who were interested in Maturin’s
productions. A writer<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> describing a visit he paid to the
novelist in the days when his fame was at its highest, says,
with reference to this <i>nom de plume</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I remarked that his assumed name of Dennis Jasper Murphy,
from its vulgar and <i>merely</i> Irish sound, must have injured the
character of ‘Montorio’ and his other romances. In this he seemed
to agree with me, observing, that at the time he was inexperienced,
and in some instances badly advised.</p>
</div>

<p>That the author was an Irishman, and without any
‘literary friend or counsellor,’ is explicitly stated in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
preface&mdash;the last-named circumstance remaining, for the
future, a constant theme of lamentation for Maturin.
No doubt there is an air of helplessness about the publication
of <i>Montorio</i>. Being unable to dispose of the copyright,
Maturin had no choice but to publish it at his own
hazard; and the bookseller again, at <i>his</i> hazard, thought it
proper to embellish the title of the book by adding the
words <i>The Fatal Revenge</i>, the name intended by the author
being only <i>The Family of Montorio</i>. In the preface
to <i>Women</i> (1818) Maturin mentions this, admitting the
addition to have been ‘a very bookselling appellation;’
but how bookselling it was is best seen by the fact that
the book did not reach a second edition before 1824.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Gothic Romance, the school of fiction founded
upon ‘the passion of supernatural fear,’ was already in
disrepute at the time <i>Montorio</i> came out. In the preface,
therefore, Maturin presents an eloquent defence of this
style of writing, which, though much abused by ‘vulgar
and unhallowed hands,’ he still maintains to be most fit
for artistic treatment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I question whether there be a source of emotion in the whole
mental frame, so powerful or universal as the <i>fear arising from
objects of invisible terror</i>. Perhaps there is no other that has been
at some period or other of life, the predominant and indelible sensation
of every mind, of every class, and under every circumstance.
Love, supposed to be the most general of passions, has certainly
been felt in its purity by very few, and by some not at all, even
in its most indefinite and simple state.</p>

<p>The same might be said, <i>a fortiori</i>, of other passions. But
who is there that has never feared? Who is there that has not
involuntarily remembered the gossip’s tale in solitude or in darkness?
Who is there that has not sometimes shivered under an influence
he would scarce acknowledge to himself? I might trace
this passion to a high and obvious source.</p>
</div>

<p>Here, in a few words, is expressed the peculiarity of the
Gothic Romance.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Its soul is terror; terror, preferably,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
if not always, arising from a cause of supernatural import.
It is often considered as a crude precursor of the magnificent
revival of the English letters with the romanticism
of the early 19:th century, nor can it be denied that in some
instances the threads of the two currents are interwoven,
and that certain details from the one are taken up and
ennobled by the other. The Byronic hero, for example,
who was to influence the poetry of Europe, has his prototype
in the Gothic Romance. Yet in its essential nature
this movement is different from all others, and, instead of
coalescing with romanticism, it is developed apart from
and alongside with it, Maturin’s <i>Melmoth</i>, which is unquestionably
the greatest production of the actual Gothic Romance,
appearing as late as 1820. According to this distinct
character of its own, the present writer would be
disposed considerably to restrict the range usually allotted
to the Gothic Romance. Especially with regard to works
in which the use of supernatural agency is eliminated,
the limit has sometimes been fixed with obvious arbitrariness;
if the occurrence only of startling incidents or violent
and extraordinary characters<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> were to be the criterion in
this respect, the Gothic Romance would include, not only
a collection of rubbish, but a great many productions
which English literature has cause to be proud of. It is
the main and only purpose of the work which must be kept
in view, and that, as in all Gothic romance, is to appeal
to the reader’s sense of fear. The terrible and revolting
elements are introduced entirely for their own sake&mdash;not,
for instance, to lend force to the total impression, or
give depth to the study of character; ghastly crimes, torture,
and painful situations form the very aim of the book,
that for which it was written. It is evident that this kind
of composition was not likely to attain any artistic excellence.
A good example of it is Shelley’s youthful story
of <i>Zastrozzi</i> (1810), probably one of the most worthless
things ever fabricated by a great poet in a moment of misdirected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
energy. A book like John Moore’s <i>Zeluco</i> (1786?),
on the other hand, can hardly be classed among the productions
of the Gothic Romance, although it is habitually
mentioned together with them; it is a dispassionate, rather
didactic display of a very vicious character, totally lacking
those qualities that are calculated to make nervous readers
afraid of going to bed.</p>

<p>The occurrence, however, of really or seemingly supernatural
elements, is the chief characteristic of the Gothic
Romance. These elements are always treated seriously;
they form the part on which the reader’s attention is meant
to be centred, the fearful sensations created by these means
being, again, what the writer aims at&mdash;as expressed in
Maturin’s preface quoted above. Another vital point there
alluded to is that the ‘passion of supernatural fear’ is intended
to come home to the reader by way of his own recollections
of moments when he has involuntarily shivered
in solitude or in darkness. In other words, the unearthly
incidents about to be told are to take place among ordinary
people, in environs more or less resembling real life. This,
in fact, is admittedly a requisite to the Gothic Romance;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and, that being so, a tale like Beckford’s <i>Vathek</i> (1781?)
ought to be excluded from the <i>Schauerromantik</i>, the meaning
of this word being limited to the definite literary movement
now in question. In <i>Vathek</i> the course of action is,
from the beginning, raised to the realm of a fairy tale from
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>; here, consequently, the supernatural
becomes ‘natural,’ never being startling or unexpected in
its mere capacity of supernaturalness, nor in any way connected
with experiences which the reader might be familiar
with.</p>

<p>The denomination ‘Gothic story’ was invented and
introduced by Horace Walpole, who furnished his <i>Castle
of Otranto</i> with this sub-title. The wonders themselves,
in this romance, are crude and primitive in the extreme,
such as statues found bleeding, and portraits walking out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of their frames. The <i>Castle of Otranto</i> was, however, greatly
admired by Scott,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> who points out that in this crudity
lies a deliberate artistic purpose of re-calling the ideas
of the distant times, when the things related would have
been ‘received as matter of great credulity.’ In its attempt
at time-colouring the <i>Castle of Otranto</i> really stands alone
among the Gothic romances where, as a rule, personages
of any time or country speak the language and express
the ideas of 18:th century England. In the present age,
indeed, the success of this effort seems very indifferent,
and the tedious horrors of Walpole proved too much even
for his direct imitators. Clara Reeve, in her <i>Champion
of Virtue</i> (1777), afterwards called <i>The Old English Baron</i>,
which she candidly confesses to have been inspired by
Walpole, prudently keeps aloof from his copious use of
supernatural elements. Yet the childish character of all
these inventions could not long satisfy the public taste
for horror, which grew very intense in the last decade of
the century. Originality was soon sacrificed to the demands
of power and suspense; <i>The Monk</i> (1795) of Matthew
Gregory Lewis, which is the best known&mdash;and probably
the worst written&mdash;of all the more famous productions
of the school of terror, consists, for the most part, of plagiarisms
from foreign sources. Only his manner of handling
his readers’ nerves without gloves was, at that time, a
novelty in English fiction. The unearthly elements in
<i>The Monk</i> comprise popular legends of ghosts that find
no rest in their graves, and one of the principal personages
is a female demon sent forth by the devil himself to
corrupt the morals of the monk Ambrosio. Compared to
the nursery-bogeys of Walpole and Clara Reeve the preternatural
world in <i>The Monk</i> is, of course, much more imposing
in itself, although the author’s treatment of his
subject-matter is exceedingly blunt and coarse. With regard
to the occurrence also of situations physically revolting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and disgusting, the school of terror celebrates one of its
doubtful triumphs in the romance of Lewis.</p>

<p>About the same time, however, the movement took
another course in a gentler direction, with the appearance
of Mrs Ann Radcliffe within the province of imagination.
She refrains altogether from representing anything actually
supernatural; whatever is made to appear so throughout
the tale, is finally explained as proceeding from some
natural cause. This innovation in the mode of composition
by no means marks an improvement from the artistic
point of view. In a story written in the Radcliffe style
a certain want of dignity is constantly felt, the reader being,
to use the words of Scott,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> ‘cheated into a sympathy’
with horrors shown, at last, to be connected with very
petty and trivial circumstances, while the ‘explanation’
tendered is often as improbable as would be an appeal to
supernatural forces. Nevertheless there still remains a sort
of halo about the work of Mrs Radcliffe. She was indeed
a far cleverer writer than either Walpole or Lewis, possessing,
in a considerable degree, the rare art of suggestion,
so important in novels of suspense. Another innovation
introduced by Mrs Radcliffe into the Gothic Romance is
an intense, romantic feeling for natural scenery. In her
tales a moonlit landscape is as indispensable as a half-ruinous
castle, and to the dreamy, sentimental atmosphere
which prevails throughout her works, her enormous popularity
was, no doubt, partly due. It was under her influence
Maturin started his career as a novelist; <i>Montorio</i> is,
as far as its construction is concerned, composed in the typical
Radcliffe style. That he was entirely in sympathy
with his subject is already seen from the preface, and the
warmth with which he speaks of Mrs Radcliffe even twelve
years later,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> clearly demonstrates that he must have been,
in his youth, one of her most ardent admirers, and thoroughly
acquainted with her works and all their peculiarities.
The following extract from Maturin’s article deserves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
to be quoted all the more so because of its being one of
the ablest and most beautiful characterizations of the
once famous authoress ever written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; her romances are irresistibly and dangerously delightful;
fitted to inspire a mind devoted to them with a species of
melancholy madness. The very light under which she paints every
object, has something fatally indulgent to such an aberration of
mind in its early and innocent, but mournful stage: her castles
and her abbeys, her mountains and her valleys, are always tinged
with the last rays of the setting sun, or the first glimpses of the
rising moon; her music is made to murmur along a stream, whose
dim waves reflect the gleam of “the star that bids the shepherd fold”;
the spires of her turrets are always silvered by moonlight, and the
recesses of her forests are only disclosed by flashes of the palest
lightning; a <i>twilight shade</i> is spread over her views of the moral,
as well as of the natural world: her heroines are “soft, modest,
melancholy, female, fair”; they have no struggles of energy, no
bursts of passion&mdash;they are born to tremble and to weep;&mdash;their
love, from its very commencement, has a tinge of despair, and their
susceptibility of nature (which seems always their strongest feeling)
has all the character of a religious resignation of its charms to
the solemn duty of extracting melancholy from its scenes; they
hang on the parting beauties of an evening landscape, and their
tears fall in solemn unison with the dews of heaven; they are
revived only by the toll of a sepulchral bell, and wander among
the graves of their departed friends, as if the intercourse of human
existence were suspended, and the living were to seek not only

<p>In spite of similarity in construction it will be seen that
the general atmosphere of <i>Montorio</i> differs greatly from
the feminine gentleness of Mrs Radcliffe&mdash;as much as it
does from the crude straightforwardness of Lewis; and it
speaks much for Maturin’s originality that he at once
succeeded in preserving a tone so distinctly his own among
patterns so highly admired.&mdash;</p>

<p>Lastly, a third class of the novel of terror is that in which
the marvellous or seemingly supernatural phenomenon is
represented as a result of scientific or quasi-scientific
occupations, and, consequently, within the limits of possibility.
Instead of receiving a ‘natural’ explanation à la
Mrs Radcliffe, the reader is referred to the effects of mesmerism,
hypnotism, or some other suggestive and incompletely
known branch of natural science. This class, of which
Edgar Allan Poe was to become the most brilliant representative&mdash;and
in which the elements strictly <i>Gothic</i>
are often dispensed with&mdash;was the latest developed of
the three. At the time <i>Montorio</i> was written, it had been
touched upon in some of the tales of the American Charles
Brockden Brown (1771-1810) which, however, it is very
uncertain whether Maturin was acquainted with. Closely
related to novels of this class are the so-called Rosicrucian
stories, which deal with alchemic pursuits; the most
celebrated of these, the <i>St. Leon</i> of William Godwin, to
which Maturin’s <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> is largely indebted,
appeared in 1799.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The plot in <i>Montorio</i> is sufficiently intricate to necessitate
a commencement of the analysis from the end and
to reveal the mystery at once.</p>

<p>The ‘fatal revenge’ is perpetrated by Orazio, count of
Montorio, upon his brother, who has, in a diabolical manner,
caused the death of his (Orazio’s) wife and the ruin of all
his family. Orazio and his younger brother are, some
twenty years before the commencement of the story, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
only surviving representatives of a house which for centuries
has been one of the most illustrious in the kingdom
of Naples. Orazio is of a brave and enthusiastic disposition,
and warmly attached to his unworthy brother; the
latter is incapable of holding any of the commissions procured
for him by Orazio, and finally marries a woman
whose family are on a decidedly hostile footing towards
his brother. At the same time Orazio himself marries a
beautiful and distinguished lady called Erminia di Amaldi,
whom, with his usual impetuosity, he drags to the altar
almost by main force. Very soon it becomes obvious to
him that his love is not reciprocated, and all the goodness
and gentleness of his wife cannot conceal the fact that
she feels profoundly unhappy. Now Orazio is reconciled
to his brother and invites him to the castle of Muralto,
the family residence. The brother, coveting the title and
estates of Montorio, determines to avail himself of the apparent
depression of Erminia, whom he hates, being a rejected
suitor of hers, while his wife, who is equally depraved,
eagerly abets him in his intentions. He conceives a plan
of exciting the jealousy of Orazio, which, considering his
vehement nature, he rightly conjectures will be of fatal
consequence. The plan is easily executed. It is generally
known that a young officer of the name of Verdoni has
been in love with Erminia before her marriage; and with
the assistance of a rascally servant dismissed by Verdoni
and taken up by the younger Montorio, the suspicions of
Orazio are awakened and successfully kept alive by means
of continual hints and allusions. Letters written by his wife
to Verdoni are thrown into his way, and at last it is even
proved that Erminia is in the habit of meeting Verdoni
at the house of a peasant, where there is a little child who
is the object of the tender care of both. Orazio’s rage knows
no bounds. Verdoni is treacherously assaulted and brought
to Muralto, where Orazio lets him be murdered before the
eyes of Erminia; which horrible sight puts an end to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
life also. Well-nigh deranged with sorrow and fear, Orazio
leaves the country and finds a solitary refuge on a small
isle in the Grecian archipelago, which is believed to be haunted
and is never visited by the people of the neighbouring
islands. Here his ‘propensities and habits cease to be those
of humanity,’ and his bodily strength and perseverance
likewise grow almost superhuman. His tranquillity is unexpectedly
disturbed by a boat landing on the shore, with
two men in it, whom he understands to speak Italian. From
a part of their conversation which he overhears, he gathers
that they are assassins sent out by the present count of
Montorio, who cannot feel at ease while his brother is alive.
In the night he is attacked by the men but easily dispatches
both of them. By the corpse of one he finds some letters
containing an account of the tragedy at Muralto, which
clearly demonstrates the innocence of Erminia. It appears
that she had been attached to Verdoni from her earliest
youth. Her father being opposed to their union, they were
married privately, and the following year Erminia was
delivered of a daughter at the house of a relative. At the
same time reports were spread of Verdoni’s death while on
an expedition, and in the meantime Erminia’s father had
compelled her to accept Orazio. When Verdoni had returned,
Erminia was the unhappy but faithful wife of another.&mdash;Such
are the tidings Orazio learns in his solitude, and
to them are added those of the death of all his children.
He lingers long in a state of stupefaction, but at length
his energies are roused and inflamed into their former fury,
whereupon a thirst for revenge is the only feeling which
fills his soul, night and day. The revenge is to fall upon
the whole family of his guilty brother, whose children,
according to Orazio’s idea of combining justice with vengeance,
are to be made the punishers of their father. Before,
however, starting to put his purpose into effect, Orazio
undertakes an extensive journey to the East where he
becomes an adept in secret and magical studies, and during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
which his mental and physical abilities are developed to the
highest perfection. Thence he returns to Italy and enters
a convent under the name of father Schemoli. As he knows
how to give himself an air of particular sanctity, he is soon
called to the castle Muralto, to be the confessor of count
Montorio, who has, by this time, become a rigid devotee.&mdash;</p>

<p>The story begins with a description of the family residing
at the ancient castle. The gloomy retirement in which
the count and countess pass their days is in no wise brightened
by the presence of the confessor who is their only
companion. Their eldest son, Ippolito, lives at Naples, as
the admired and brilliant leader of the pleasures and dissipations
of its <i>jeunesse dorée</i>, while the younger, Annibal, who
is of a timid, melancholy, and suspicious disposition, is an
inhabitant of Muralto. The members of the family have,
from time immemorial, been noted for their love of magic
and the preternatural. It is subsequently upon this inclination
which the young men, otherwise so different, have in
common, that the monk bases his scheme of inducing them
to destroy their father. The story is one of a continuous,
unrelenting process of strong mental suggestion, operating
through its victims’ readiness to believe in supernatural
agency. The plot goes forward alternately at the castle
and at Naples; the adventures of Annibal are told by himself
in letters to his brother. Muralto is furnished with
everything required for a scene of ‘Gothic incidents.’ There
is an old, uninhabited wing of the castle, with a cemetery-chapel
partly in ruins, and no end of secret doors, intricate
passages, and subterranean vaults. It is the delight of
Annibal to ramble about in these desolate places; he has
heard that a mystery is connected with the sudden and tragical
end of the late possessor of the castle, whose fate greatly
excites his curiosity. He attaches himself to an old servant
who apparently knows more than he dares disclose. Much
against his will the old man is persuaded to accompany Annibal
on his nocturnal visits to the deserted part of the building&mdash;nocturnal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
because the count is suspected to be very
unfavourably disposed towards this kind of occupation.
With difficulty they open the long-shut door to the apartments
used by count Orazio. A portrait of the countess
Erminia makes a profound impression upon Annibal, who
feels assured that the original is still in the land of the
living; he makes a copy of the picture, which he always
carries about him. These excursions are exactly what Schemoli
would wish, it being very easy for him, with his familiarity
with all the recesses of the building, to awaken superstitious
fear in the visitants. At times they see a human figure
issuing, as it were, directly out of the wall; they hear mysterious
steps and observe strange lights moving around
them. Blood is detected on the floors, and in a cavity of
the wall a skeleton is discovered. Once the old man disappears,
for a while, as if swallowed up by the tombs. Shortly
afterwards he dies, without being able to reveal what he has
seen among the dead; he merely repeats that ‘the house
of Montario must fall!’ Attended by a nephew of the old
man, called Filippo, who now becomes his companion, Annibal
continues to explore the ruins, until one night they are
surprised by the count and Schemoli. The count, in a fury
which betrays him to be conscious of a crime, has Annibal
imprisoned in a lonely chamber in the castle, where, for
some time to come, he beholds no face but that of the monk.
At this stage Schemoli deems it fit to commence his work.
He never speaks to the prisoner, or heeds his queries, by
day; but every night at twelve he emerges from his castle
of silence and sallies forth to Annibal’s room, where he serves
up a fantastical story which he pretends to be allowed
to relate at that hour only. He tells that he is the spirit
of the dead body discovered by Annibal in the chapel. His
life has been wild and sinful, and he has suffered a violent
death. The body Annibal now sees before him is one two
thousand years old, re-animated to become the abode of
his spirit, until his real body is properly interred and vengeance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
wreaked upon his murderer. This task an implacable
fate has destined to be executed by Annibal; and he is made
to understand&mdash;although it is never distinctly uttered&mdash;that
the criminal he must punish is his father. Annibal
repudiates the idea with indignation, but Schemoli calmly
repeats that his fate is inevitable, and that he is compelled
to pursue Annibal everywhere until the deed is done. The
mind of Annibal is already beginning to give way under the
regular pressure of Schemoli, when these midnightly visits
are suddenly interrupted. Annibal has, for some time, been
permitted to enjoy the society of Filippo.&mdash;The count
had promised to send Filippo to another of his estates, while
the ruffian who was to be his guide had received a secret
commission to murder him on the way. After a marvellous
escape, however, Filippo had boldly returned to the castle
and offered himself to act as a spy upon Annibal.&mdash;As
he is really devoted to Annibal, he has the difficult task
of operating as a double spy; but in this he succeeds so well
as to find out that his master is to be poisoned by the monk.
Through the dexterous management of Filippo, the draught
prepared for Annibal is swallowed by Schemoli himself,
after which the prisoners make their escape from the castle.
Annibal determines to proceed to Naples to his brother, but
on arriving there he learns that Ippolito has just left the
town in a state of desperation.&mdash;</p>

<p>Interesting as are Annibal’s letters to his brother, Ippolito
pays them but little attention, being wholly absorbed
by business of his own. He has run across a stranger who
exercises a mysterious, irresistible ascendancy over his mind.
This stranger, otherwise father Schemoli, introduces himself
to Ippolito in a manner calculated to excite, by degrees,
his interest and curiosity; speaking, at first, but little at
a time and then disappearing. Ippolito is usually called
to meet him by letters which he finds in his room, none of
his servants being able to explain how they get there.
Soon it is generally observed that Ippolito is in the habit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of spending his nights at some unknown place whence he
always returns with a pale and haggard appearance; and
when at times he takes part in his former amusements, he
does so with the wild despair of one who wishes to escape
his own thoughts. His young page, Cyprian, who takes
tender care of him, endeavours, by every means, to keep
him at home; sometimes he reads a diary to him, partly in
verse and partly in prose, written by a nun and dedicated
to some one she is hopelessly attached to. The gentle influence
of Cyprian, however, is no match for the miraculous
power of Schemoli. When midnight arrives, Ippolito departs.
Once he has invited a company of friends to his house, but
at the usual hour a gigantic figure, with his face concealed
in a mask, appears among them, beckoning to Ippolito,
who submissively follows him. Their destination is a subterranean
vault, whither Ippolito is always conducted blindfold,
and the purpose of these excursions is to impress upon
him that he is ordered, by fate, to commit an extraordinary
deed. Just as in the case of Annibal, the monk enjoins
upon Ippolito that he himself labours under the same fate,
and that his is no voluntary service; and the credulous
mind of Ippolito soon proves susceptible to the imposture.
One night he is informed that ‘the hour is come.’ He is
again conducted to the vaults where he is received by several
figures fantastically attired; after a multitude of mysterious
rites and ceremonies he is shown, by a pantomimic
display, that he is destined to commit a murder against
his will, and also who is to be his victim. Like Annibal
he is seized with violent indignation, but the serenity of
Schemoli remains unperturbed. In great despair Ippolito
leaves Naples at the very time Annibal arrives there from
Muralto.</p>

<p>Ippolito roams about in the neighbourhood of Naples,
without any definite object in view. His journey, however,
soon becomes very painful. It appears that rumour
has travelled ahead of him and spread news of his magical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
pursuits and his supposed alliance with the devil. Everywhere
he is received with maledictions and threatened with
the Inquisition; and, worst of all, he seems to be followed
by the dreaded figure of his persecutor. Once he passes a
night in a large, deserted building, where strange voices
and footsteps induce him to descend into a subterranean
locality of vast dimensions. There he is joined by Schemoli,
who reminds him of the uselessness of trying to avoid his
fate. He then leaves Ippolito to wander about in darkness,
until he discerns two figures advancing before him in the
dim light of a lantern. One of them is Schemoli, and the
other a monk who carries the lifeless form of a young female.
After a while the former is seen to depart, and the monk,
with apparent hesitation, prepares to plunge a dagger into
the breast of the lady; frightened by Ippolito he releases
her and makes his escape. Ippolito seizes the lady and,
following the course taken by the monk, emerges at last
into the garden of a cloister. In fresh air the lady revives
and learns with joy the name of her preserver. She informs
him that she has been forcibly separated from his brother
Annibal, and implores him to save her. There is a river flowing
through the garden; seeing a boat Ippolito springs
into it, but before he has time to assist her to follow him,
the river is disturbed by an earthquake, and the boat is
borne along with great rapidity. After a perilous course
Ippolito gets safely ashore, and his ramblings begin again.
Yet the suspicions entertained against him are gaining
strength every moment, and at last he is imprisoned by the
members of the Inquisition. He is repeatedly examined,
but nothing worse happens to him so far as the Holy Office
is concerned. Schemoli, however, regularly visits him in
his cell. Ippolito’s power of resistance has nearly vanished,
when he is once more released by another earthquake, which
rends asunder the prison-tower of the Inquisition. With
the few surviving inhabitants of the town he embarks for
Sicily, but the bark is wrecked and Ippolito drifts ashore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
where he is received by Schemoli. Now he passively yields
to the will of his persecutor, who conducts him first to Naples
and then to the castle of Muralto.&mdash;</p>

<p>Annibal, not finding his brother at Naples, betakes himself
to Puzzoli, to seek protection with a relative of his
mother, a distinguished ecclesiastic, who lives at enmity with
his father. On his way he arrives at a small town by a river
which, just then, threatens the inhabitants with an inundation;
the nuns of an Ursuline convent are arranging a
solemn procession to induce the saint to prevent the impending
calamity. In that procession Annibal detects the original
of the picture which he still cherishes as his dearest
treasure. In ecstasies he rushes to the lady, beginning to
address her&mdash;to the strong resentment of the nuns&mdash;when
the flood suddenly comes on with terrible force. Annibal
is separated from the object of his rapture, but, in the
general confusion at last finds her and succeeds in saving
her from the water. She is taken back to the convent, but
Annibal contrives clandestinely to meet her. It appears
that she is a novice called Ildefonsa, and is forced to take
the veil much against her inclinations. Annibal now writes
to his relative to request him to interfere on behalf of Ildefonsa.
His effort is crowned with success in so far as a letter
really arrives from the bishop of the diocese, ordering
the removal of Ildefonsa from the convent; but shortly
before this Annibal has seen the well-known figure of Schemoli
glide past him, and from that moment he is plunged
into desperate gloom which nothing is able to dispel. Nor
is he mistaken in his forebodings of evil. The messenger
bringing the bishop’s letter is sent back with the intelligence
that Ildefonsa is dead. Assisted by his faithful Filippo,
however, Annibal finds out that this is not the case; accordingly,
at the funeral procession, he steps forward accusing
the abbess of having arranged a mock funeral, after immuring
Ildefonsa in the dungeons of the convent. The abbess
allows him to remove the pall, and, to his astonishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
he sees the lifeless form of Ildefonsa. The indignation of
the public is now directed against Annibal; he is even
imprisoned on account of his extraordinary conduct. Ildefonsa,
however, who is not dead but only rendered insensible
by a strong opiate, is conveyed to the vaults where Ippolito
accidentally saves her from the hands of her enemies. The
earthquake which separates Ildefonsa from Ippolito, reunites
her with Annibal, whose prison is crushed to pieces.
After some time spent in close retirement they venture to
set out for Puzzoli. Their guide proves to be bribed by
Schemoli, and they are attacked by his attendants, whereupon
Annibal is severely wounded. When he comes to his
senses he finds himself in the power of his persecutor. By
this time he is also a broken man, and bereft of all further
power of resistance he consents to all the propositions of
Schemoli. He only expresses a wish that there might be
another human being in the same condition as himself&mdash;and
Schemoli has no reason to conceal that there is one: his
brother Ippolito. Annibal follows Schemoli to Muralto,
where he unexpectedly finds Ildefonsa lying on her death-bed.
He has no opportunity, however, to inquire into her
fate, for the fatal night draws on apace. That same night
the count Montorio is, more than ever, beset by pangs of
conscience. He dare not be left alone for a moment, although
his wife is quite unable to soothe him. At last he summons
the confessor to give him absolution, and now, for the first
time, confesses to him that he has tried to palliate his crime
by rearing the children of his unhappy brother as his own:
Ippolito and Annibal are the sons of his brother Orazio....
The confessor rushes out to the youths, but is powerless to
utter one articulate sound. Nor would it be of any avail;
in a trance-like condition they enter the count’s apartment,
and their swords meet in his body.&mdash;</p>

<p>At the moment of the young men’s arrest, Orazio surrenders
himself to justice, protesting that he alone is guilty.
He asks permission to compose a written account of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
has happened, and in this he reveals his identity, relates the
story of his early misfortunes, and explains the method
adopted by him to carry out his vengeance, which is fatally
visited upon himself, his own children becoming murderers
at his instigation.&mdash;As for Ildefonsa, she is the unacknowledged
daughter of Erminia and Verdoni, and the very picture
of her mother. Montorio destines her for a convent
to get rid of her; when she is brought to the castle by Schemoli’s
attendants, we are told that Montorio, ‘on beholding
her, felt a long extinguished passion for her mother
revive. To gratify a romantic illusion of posthumous passion
she was arrayed in fantastic splendour by the count, and
to appease fear and jealousy, was poisoned by his wife.’&mdash;Ippolito
is, in his prison, visited by his former page, who
turns out to be a woman called Rosolia di Valozzi. After
seeing him once, in the days of his splendour, an irresistible
passion had made her quit her convent and enter his service;
the diary she used to read to him referred to herself and
her attachment to Ippolito. Now her health is undermined,
and she expires shortly after her secret is revealed.</p>

<p>Ippolito and Annibal are finally released, but banished
from the country for ever. Orazio is condemned to death;
but at the last interview with his sons he bursts ‘one of
the larger vessels’ and dies, rejoicing that ‘the last of the
Montorios has not perished on a scaffold.’</p>

<p>In a short introduction to <i>Montorio</i> it is narrated how
two young officers enter the French service at the siege of
Barcelona 1697, and distinguish themselves as much by
their reckless intrepidity as by their melancholy aloofness
from their comrades. When the city is taken both of them
perish; and an Italian officer, who is the only person acquainted
with their history, relates all that follows.&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would not be possible to give an account of all the
windings of this intricate production, which is said<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
contain ‘sufficient sparkle and movement for half a dozen
ordinary romances.’ An extract from another critic<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> likewise
goes to show&mdash;besides the fact that <i>Montorio</i> had its admirers&mdash;that
it is not such a very easy matter to trace even
the bare outlines of Maturin’s first story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the “House (sic) of Montorio” there is a vast exuberance of
all the impulses of humanity,&mdash;the young passions, fantasies
and aspirations, dancing and eddying like the waters of a gushing
fountain, and sparkling in the coloured light of romance. Plot,
sentiment, character, and description, in an abundance that seems
to mock the anxious effort of ordinary genius, and to perplex the
youthful author with his own riches, mark the entire of this extraordinary
production.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet all these riches, unfortunately, rest on an unsubstantial
foundation. The Radcliffe style of composition requires,
in fact, the prudence and moderation practised by its originator,
in order to preserve anything like an artistic balance.
It follows from the very nature of a story of this kind, that
the more the scope of action is enlarged, the more unsatisfactory
is the inevitable explanation, and the greater the
disappointment felt at the implausibility of the solution.
In <i>Montorio</i> the disproportion between cause and effect
is nothing less than prodigious; and such elements as would
actually be grand and imposing in the plan itself, are, in the
course of execution, sadly affected by the air of charlatanism
inseparable from a plot constructed in the Radcliffe
manner. It would be different, and far more satisfactory,
if the brothers were, for instance, represented as acting
under a kind of hypnotic influence. As it is, the scheme of
Orazio is, essentially, carried out by means of talking sheer
nonsense to two full-grown people; and facilitated by accidents
and singular coincidences which are as incredible as
would be the appearance of all the legions of the supernatural
world. The wonderful talents of Orazio, above all
his capacity of swiftly covering great distances, become
almost unnecessary, considering the never-ending maze of
secret passages and subterranean recesses at his disposal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
there are no two apartments, far or near, unconnected by
these means of escape, if need be, and the strangest thing
of all is that Orazio, after an absence of twenty years, still
is the only person perfectly acquainted with them, wherever
they are. For him there is no more difficulty in smuggling
letters to Ippolito’s room at Naples, than in suddenly turning
up in the prison-cell of the Inquisition. Among other extraordinary
circumstances contributing to the success of Orazio’s
enterprise, the occurrence of two earthquakes with the same
issue, the liberation of a person from his prison by crushing
its walls, is the most unfortunate. This repetition of an
event which, even if introduced singly, makes unusual claims
upon the reader’s credulity, seriously cools his excitement
even at the first perusal. As for any recurrent enjoyment,
it has very appropriately been pointed out by Scott,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that
a composer of Radcliffe romances cannot expect his productions
to be relished twice or oftener. When everything
mysterious and suggestive is carefully explained, there is
nothing left to excite curiosity or keep the mind in suspense
a second time, as is often the case with powerfully told
supernatural incidents which receive no explanation whatever.
It is almost intolerable to re-read <i>Montorio</i>, from
beginning to end, in spite of the many impressive passages
it contains. However, as it is unavoidable in a story constructed
in accordance with the principles of <i>Montorio</i>,
that the elaborate fabric collapses at the final revelation of
the ‘truth’ and the placing side by side of causes and effects,
it must still be considered as a success in its kind if this does
not happen too soon; and in <i>Montorio</i> the reader is, until
the explanation of Orazio, really kept believing that the
incidents related are of a preternatural character. Hence
the ‘passion of supernatural fear,’ though capable of being
inspired only once, is as genuine as that which any Gothic
story is likely to create. As far as the purely terrific element
is concerned, it has justly been observed<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that ‘<i>Montorio</i>
surpasses all the excellences of Ann Radcliffe and Godwin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
combined.’ An atmosphere of intense suspense is brought
about by the parallel development of two actions, always
broken off at the most interesting point, and the vigour,
vivacity, and youthful freshness of the style also leaves
far behind all that which had been produced, up to 1807,
within the Gothic Romance.</p>

<p>Of the two actions the adventures going on at Muralto
form the happier one, the tricks of Orazio being, in this
instance, far more probable. In the gloomy surroundings
where the very air is filled with surmises of some mysterious
and horrible secret, it is not unnatural that Orazio should
succeed in appealing to the superstitious tendencies of the
melancholy-minded Annibal, nor is it astonishing that he
is thoroughly acquainted with all the localities of his own
castle. The fearful expectations with which Annibal looks
forward to his nightly excursions, are cleverly transferred
to the reader:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The hour is approaching&mdash;a few moments more, and the
castle bell will toll. The hour that I have longed for, I almost
begin now to wish more distant. I almost dread to hear the steps
of Michelo.... Hark! the bell tolls&mdash;the old turret seems
to rock its echo; and the silence that succeeds, how deep, how
stilly!&mdash;would I could hear an owl scream across me! Ha! ’twas
the lightning that gleamed across me. I will go to the casement;
the roar of the elements will be welcome at such a moment as this....
The night is dark and unruly&mdash;the wind bursts in strong
and fitful blasts against the casement. The clouds are hurried along
in scattering masses. There is a murmur from the forests below,
that in a lighter hour I could trust fancy to listen to; but, in my
present mood, I dare not follow her wanderings. Would my old
guide were come! I feel that any state of fear is supportable, accompanied
by the sight or sound of a human being.... Was that
shriek fancy?&mdash;again, again&mdash;impossible! Hark! there is a
tumult in the castle&mdash;lights and voices beneath the turret....
What is it they tell me?</p>
</div>

<p>Every night some new discovery is made, ingeniously
calculated to increase his curiosity, and the marvellous
occurrences become more and more startling, until the
climax is reached in the night-scene where Orazio suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
drags the old servant after him into the vault, and there
addresses him ‘in the hollow voice of death.’ The mind of
his victim being thus sufficiently prepared for his purpose,
Orazio rouses the count, and Annibal is conveyed to his
lonely prison. The tale which Orazio here unfolds to him
is one of the boldest flights of ‘terrific’ imagination: a description
of the abode of unblessed spirits, where he has
been condemned to linger before entering the ancient body
kept unconsumed amid magical flames&mdash;in which shape
his doom then is involved into Annibal’s. A comparison
of this fantasia to the mummery by which Ippolito is informed
of his fate is of interest as a proof of the injustice Maturin
did to his own talents in applying them to the Radcliffe
style of composition. With Ippolito the means resorted to
are as follows. Orazio takes into his service a number of
professional impostors who, in the subterranean vaults into
which Ippolito is conducted, act the part of beings of another
world. Masks, modelled in wax, are procured of Ippolito
and the count, so that, in the figure which suggests to him
the idea of a murderer, Ippolito recognizes himself. Then
he is induced to plunge his poniard into the breast of another
waxen figure whose face, when disclosed, reveals the features
of his father. Now all this, when subsequently explained,
appears extremely cheap; but even the account of the
performance itself has none of the unearthly power of the
tale told to Annibal. That tale is the only passage in the
book in which Maturin gives rein to his imagination and
which has the enduring merit of being subjected to no
trivial explanation, certain to destroy every impression.
The reader is also much more disposed to accept as a fact
that Annibal believes what is only told to him, than that
Ippolito is convinced of what he is made actually to experience.
The plot laid at Muralto is, moreover, interspersed
with scenes powerful in effect, relating to the state of the
conscience-stricken count Montorio. That he has committed
some formidable offence is clear from the very first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
though it is, of course, merely mentioned allusively. The
characters of the count and his wife&mdash;who are never haunted
but by their own thoughts&mdash;are those most vividly
depicted. Montorio is totally broken down by fear and
repentance, and clings anxiously to the offices of religion;
his nights are passed in raving under the pressure of hideous
dreams, represented with great zest and spirit. The countess,
on the other hand, is as strong as he is weak, and outwardly
as calm and proud as he is restless and dejected. Without
uttering a complaint she undergoes a penance of her own
invention, wearing a sharp iron belt around her waist. This
contrast between her self-restraint and his cowardly despair
is, upon the whole, skilfully effected. Otherwise characterization,
in <i>Montorio</i>, yields place to adventure, for under
the exceptional circumstances in which the principal personages
find themselves, they act by necessity rather than
by choice. Yet the difference said to exist between Ippolito
and Annibal also clearly asserts itself when their wanderings
begin. Annibal, who has the deeper mind of the two, is
fully persuaded that his persecutor is a preternatural being;
and thus, though he is apparently more composed, his calmness
is more dangerous than the impetuosity of Ippolito,
and he is far nearer to surrendering himself. Ippolito does not
debate whether the powers by which he is beset be human
or superhuman; following his first impulse he goes on to
treat them with ‘sallies of rage and convulsions of resistance.’
From this difference in their characters, by which their
subsequent adventures are fixed, it follows that those of
Annibal are, even henceforth, more satisfactory from an
artistic point of view. His encounters with Orazio are
simple and natural, there being no further need of any
extraordinary tricks for his bewilderment. The draught
emptied by the confessor at Muralto he firmly believes to
be poison, while it is only a strong opiate, from the effects
of which Orazio easily recovers. Consequently it is sufficient
for Annibal to see Orazio glide past him in the garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of the convent, in order to disperse the last shadow of doubt
as to his superhuman character; and when he again falls
into the hands of Orazio after being separated from Ildefonsa,
he could not reasonably be expected to offer any
further resistance. Ippolito, on the other hand, before his
strength is exhausted, continues to be hurried through subterranean
passages without end and marvellous experiences
defying all natural explanation of any kind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The productions of the Gothic Romance, owing to its
limited range and peculiar character, naturally present
obvious similarities among themselves. The fundamental
principle of them all is an appeal to the same source of
emotion;&mdash;from their very appellation we may deduce
a common background to most of them, and the motifs
with which the ‘terrific’ imagination loves to occupy itself
are always less remarkable for variety than for suitability
to imitation, according to the special genius of each successive
writer. In <i>Montorio</i> there is as ample proof of Maturin’s
indebtedness to his predecessors within the school of terror,
as of his unquestionable originality. The idea of a supernatural
imposture of intricate apparatus and vast dimensions
Maturin might have received from <i>Der Geisterseher</i> (1789)
of Schiller, of which a translation was much read and relished
at that time in England. In Schiller’s story a mysterious
Armenian possesses the same surprising familiarity with
other people’s concerns, and the same exaggerated facility
of appearing when and where he chooses, as Orazio. There
is also a Sicilian necromancer, a ghost-seer by profession,
who gives a minute description of the tricks he and his
compeers are in the habit of practising while trading upon
people’s credulity, which affords a parallel to the performances
of the hirelings employed by Orazio at Naples. Complications
like these are, at all events, foreign to the novels
of Mrs Radcliffe, of which especially <i>The Italian</i> (1797)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
is often called to mind by <i>Montorio</i>. In this romance the
principal plotter and schemer is a monk called Schedoni,
and he, as regards external appearance at least, is distinctly
a precursor of Orazio, <i>alias</i> father Schemoli.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> They have
the same large, gaunt figure, hollow voice and unearthly
appearance in general, and both enjoy a reputation of uncommon
sanctity, very little deserved by either. However,
Schedoni has, in his former life, been a villain of an ordinary
kind, who possesses none of the grandeur of spirit by which
Orazio is distinguished, nor are his machinations pursued
on a scale at all comparable to that invented by Maturin’s
hero. The simpler adventures of Annibal, on the other
hand, are typically Radcliffeian: in <i>The Italian</i>, too, mysterious
footsteps allure inquisitive young men to dangerous
places, ghastly voices disturb the stillness of ruinous chapels,
and nocturnal flights are undertaken through sombre forests.
Yet this is not the only point of contact between the two
romances. A general characteristic shared by Gothic stories
with very few exceptions, was the placing of the scene
in the Mediterranean countries, in this case in the South
of Italy. Besides the romantic charm those regions always
suggest to a northern imagination, they possessed the special
merit of admitting the introduction of the Inquisition with
all its horrors, and affording an opportunity of penetrating
the walls of a convent. To Maturin, with his strong anti-catholic
tendencies, the theme of ecclesiastical cruelty was
doubly welcome, and in his treatment of the subject there
is always a tone of genuine indignation, distinct from all
aims of a literary character. The absolute power of the
Holy Office and the abuses of monastical authority were,
in a forcible manner, illustrated already in Lewis’s <i>Monk</i>,
nor were these attractions withstood by Mrs Radcliffe.
The passages in <i>The Italian</i>, relative to the prison of the
Inquisition at Rome, are among the greatest triumphs
of her method of arousing the reader’s anxiety only to be
soothed again. The hero is several times brought to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
utmost point of being submitted to torture; at one time
he is already fastened to the rack, but the procedure is
always suspended. The examinations of other less fortunate
prisoners are suggested only by feeble groans and expressive
allusions, still by these scanty means a most gruesome
atmosphere is created. Maturin, in <i>Montorio</i>, follows <i>The
Italian</i> in so far as bodily torture is not resorted to&mdash;it
would, indeed, be very much out of place, the plan of Orazio
tending to subdue Ippolito by working upon his mental
faculties. Maturin even, contrary to Mrs Radcliffe, represents
the chief inquisitor as a man of some humanity; but
at the same time he takes care to give a powerful picture
of the demoralizing influence a superstitious religion exercises
upon the people. The report of Ippolito’s heretical
inclinations spreads like wild-fire, and wherever he arrives
he is viewed with hatred and abhorrence. In vain he approaches
man or woman; all refuse to listen to his protestations,
to which the sole answers are curses and maledictions.
Here, evidently, a literary impulse outside the actual
school of terror asserts itself. Ippolito’s situation is as desperate
and as passionately depicted as Caleb’s in Godwin’s
<i>Caleb Williams</i> (1794), when he is accused of robbery by
Falkland and appearances are strongly against him; he is
regarded as the ‘opprobrium of the human species’ and is
allowed no opportunity to defend himself, nobody deigning
to lend an ear to his demonstrations. Caleb and Ippolito
are both, at last, driven to seek the mercy of an old man of
mild and venerable aspect, and both, alike, are sadly disappointed.
In Godwin the old man calls the unfortunate
youth ‘a monster with whom the earth groans,’ and deplores
that he has ever seen him or uttered a single word to him;
in Maturin he laments at having lived too long being thus
forced to behold Ippolito, and declares that his grey hairs
are defiled by the appeal Ippolito makes to them. This
pathetic description of the involuntary isolation of a man
among his fellow-beings, this heart-rending agony of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
upon seeing the ties broken that unite him to his species,
is born of the spirit of a time in which feeling was raised
to the seat of honour. A strong sense of loneliness, of some
sort or other, is an essential feature of the romantic literature
of the period, and will often be seen to recur in Maturin’s
writings. Here, under the influence of Godwin, it is expressed
in its most painful aspect. <i>Caleb Williams</i> is a protest
against the ‘despotism by which man becomes the destroyer
of man;’ while Godwin directs his attacks against wrongs
in the existing state of social institutions, Maturin traces
the source of evil in misapplied religious ideas. The result,
however, is the same, and Caleb might well have uttered
the words in which Ippolito sums up the state he is
reduced to:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then I am outlawed of nature. I am divested of the rights
of being. Every ear is deaf, and every heart is iron to me. Wherever
I tread the sole of my foot dries the streams of humanity.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>An incident, in <i>Montorio</i>, of monastic oppression, is represented
by the episode of Ildefonsa. A young lady held
in a convent against her will was a special favourite with
the novelists of terror; the episode in question is, no doubt,
suggested by the history of Agnes de Medina in <i>The Monk</i>.
For the liberation of Agnes, also, an appeal is made to
high ecclesiastical authorities, whereupon the tyrannical
abbess compels her to swallow an opiate which plunges
her into a death-like state, arranges a mock funeral and
has Agnes conveyed to the hideous dungeons of the convent.
In <i>The Italian</i>, too, the heroine is placed in a convent
where she feels but ill at ease under the government of an
unkind prioress; however, she succeeds in escaping with her
lover. Mention is also made of a stone chamber ‘within the
deepest recesses of the convent’ where disobedient nuns have
sometimes been confined&mdash;but thither the gentle authoress
forbears to conduct her readers.</p>

<p>Yet another episode in <i>Montorio</i> is inspired by ‘the powerful
and wicked romance of the Monk,’ which was, in Maturin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
opinion,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> ‘the most extraordinary production’ of the
time of its appearance. It has been told that Annibal’s
servant, Filippo, incurs the displeasure of the count for
assisting at the investigations of his master, and is sent
away from Muralto. His guide conducts him into a large
house where they are expected by a party of bandits. Filippo
is ushered into a room on the upper floor and there finds
out that he is to be despatched during the night, yet effects
a hair-breadth escape by a passage below the apartment.
The episode, though of considerable length, is completely
detached from the main plot and introduced solely for the
sake of delineating Filippo’s sensations when threatened
with horrible and immediate death. Lewis relates, with
the same laudable purpose, how Don Raymond and some
other travellers pass a night at the house of a man who
turns out to be the leader of a gang of robbers, and how
they, too, succeed in eluding the danger. Differently as
the adventures are made up, still one conspicuous detail in
<i>Montorio</i> comes very near direct plagiarism. In the first
as well as in the second story the victim is made aware of
his danger by the hostess of the house, who, though of a
surly aspect, appears to disapprove of the impending proceedings.
The robber’s wife, in a whisper, warns Don Raymond
to look at the sheets of his bed, which are stained
with blood; Filippo is called by the hag who manages the
household of the bandits, to examine a particular corner
of his room which he, also, finds to be blood-stained. Otherwise
the episode in <i>Montorio</i> is certainly much more exciting
than the one in <i>The Monk</i>.</p>

<p>Aside from these instances of immediate influence from
some of the most admired productions of the Gothic Romance,
<i>Montorio</i> exhibits many minor traits characteristic
of the school in general. Among these is the committing,
either consciously or unconsciously, of great wrongs against
near relations. The happiness of Orazio is destroyed by
his brother, and Orazio himself unwittingly ruins the life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of his sons. Of secondary characters, both attendants of
Annibal at Muralto are very typical of a genuine Gothic
story: the old and decrepit domestic who, in a provokingly
imperfect way, attempts to satisfy the curiosity of the hero,
and the young and ready-witted fellow, who stoutly follows
him in his breakneck adventures. Yet in one vital point
<i>Montorio</i> occupies an almost exceptional place within the
Gothic Romance, namely, with regard to the highly tragical
issue of all its incidents. In spite of its blood-curdling
qualities, the novel of terror by no means excludes a happy
end for the hero and the heroine; the reader may be made
to wander about in charnel-houses for ever so long, but
finally he is led to a nuptial chamber as infallibly as in other
stories that have boasted of a wide and merited popularity.
This rule was, rashly enough, disregarded by Maturin; when
Helene Richter<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> says that ‘alle Schauerromane haben
ein glückliches Ende, und würde es auch an den Haaren
herbeigezogen,’ she evidently forgets <i>Montorio</i>. Maturin
adhered faithfully to the programme he had fixed for his
romance&mdash;to found it upon the passion of the supernatural
fear alone, not troubling himself about the traditional
compensation for the horrors. There is, in fact, no
heroine in the book; it was not without cause that <i>Montorio</i>,
as Maturin states in the preface to his next work,
was pronounced to be ‘deficient in female interest.’ Ildefonsa
is there to fill but a short episode, and is, moreover,
discovered to be Annibal’s sister. As a type she is modelled
according to the innocent and persecuted young ladies in
Mrs Radcliffe’s stories, being in no wise remarkable among
the female characters Maturin has depicted. Still less likely
is Rosolia to satisfy the demands for a heroine. Matters
never develop to an understanding between her and Ippolito;
her sex is not even revealed before it would be too
late to invent a happy solution. Rosolia is introduced into
the story, in the development of which she takes no part,
merely in order to intersperse it with her lyrical effusions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
A character like this is not uncommon in the Gothic Romance.
It may be mentioned that Don Raymond, in <i>The
Monk</i>, also has a page who composes ballads which he,
like Rosolia, subjects to the benevolent judgment of his
master. The diary Rosolia presents to Ippolito is rather
unsubstantial in matter, but some of the prose passages
are exquisitely graceful and truly Maturineian in style.&mdash;</p>

<p>There is, however, within the compass of <i>Montorio</i>,
one complete and consummate story where female interest
is also attended to. Orazio’s account of his early misfortunes&mdash;immediately
preceding the disheartening explanation
of the details of his revenge&mdash;admittedly contains the
best parts of the book.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The progress of the violent action
is admirably concentrated, and the rapidity and poignancy
of the style is powerfully indicative of the anguish felt by
the writer. The character of Orazio, before he becomes
the superhuman being known as father Schemoli, is illustrated
with a few vigorous strokes. The motif itself&mdash;a
tragedy ensuing from the groundless suspicions of a jealous
husband&mdash;is not original. Mangan<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> points out that the
idea had been utilized by Edward Young in <i>The Revenge</i>
(1721), though, he adds, ‘Maturin has contrived to invest
it with a new and overpowering interest.’ In Young’s tragedy
the revenge is taken by a Moor called Zanga upon his
master, a distinguished Spaniard, who has wronged him.
Zanga helps him first to marry the lady he loves, and then
ingeniously awakens his jealousy by means of forged letters
and pictures deposited in suitable places. The lady, upon
finding herself suspected, commits suicide, and her husband,
when undeceived, follows her example. The plot
of Orazio’s narrative certainly bears similarity to <i>The
Revenge</i>, and it is not impossible that Maturin may have
received an impulse from Young, although it seems somewhat
far-fetched to refer to this comparatively little known
play, as long as <i>Othello</i> remains the great prototype of a
tragedy of his kind. In this respect, at least, Maturin shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
originality, that he allows Orazio to remain alive and only
after a long interval be informed of his fatal mistake. Fantastic
as is Orazio’s situation on the islet, it required unusual
imaginative power to treat it so as to render it credible;
however, Maturin was equal to the task. Here are to be
found the most splendid proofs of his prose-style&mdash;compared
to which the metrical pieces scattered through the work
are of very great inferiority&mdash;showing to what degree of
excellence it was capable of rising even at that early period.
It is most pathetically described how the innocent victims
of Orazio’s rashness are never out of his mind&mdash;how they
seem to threaten him when nightly tempests are roaring
around him and how, at moments of fortuitous tranquillity,
he endeavours to imagine them in a state of glory:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The dreams of the night are easily dissolved, and strange shapes
are sometimes seen to shimmer through the twilight of a cavern;
but I have met them at noon on the bare sunny shore. I have seen
them on the distant wave when its bed was smooth and bright as
jasper; the curtained mist that hung on mole and breaker, and
mingled with the sheeted spanglings of the surf floated back from
them, did not throw a fringe of its shadowy mantling on their forms.
I could not be deceived. Sometimes the light was glorious beyond
imagination. Towards sunset I would sometimes see a small white
cloud, and watch its approach; it would fix on a point of the rock
that rose beside my cave; as twilight thickened it would unfold,
its centre disclosing a floating throne of pearl, and its skirts expanding
into wings of iris and aurelia that upbore it. By moonlight
the pomp grew richer, and the vision became exceeding glorious.
Myriads of lucent shapes were visible in that unclouded shower of
light which fell from the moon on the summit of the rock; myriads
swam on its opal waves, wafted in a fine web of filmy radiancy, canopied
with a lily’s cup, and inebriate with liquid light. Among them
sat the shadows of the lovers, sparkling with spheral light, and throned
in the majesty of vision, but pale with the traces of mortality.
There sat the lovers in sad and shadowy state together; so greatly
unfortunate, so fatal, passing fond. Sometimes when stretched on
my cold, lone bed, I have heard her voice warbling on the wind
touches of sweet, sad music, such as I have heard her sing when she
thought herself alone and unheard. I have risen and followed it,
and heard it floating on the waters; I listened, and would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
given worlds to weep. On a sudden the sounds would change to the
most mournful and wailing cries, and Erminia, pale and convulsed
as I saw her last, would pass before me, pointing to a gory shape
that the waves would throw at my feet. Then they would plunge
together into the waters, and where far off the moon shed a wan
and cloudy light on the mid wave, I would see their visages rise
dim and sad, and hear their cry die along the waste of waters.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>There are, in the prefaces to Maturin’s both second and
third work, hints that his first romance had been subjected
to unfavourable criticism on the part of the reviewers. In
the leading periodicals of the time, however, no such are
to be found. The only article upon the book, that of Scott
in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, did not appear until three years
after the publication of <i>Montorio</i>. It is not quite so panegyrical
as maintained by some of Maturin’s biographers,
although the conspicuous talent of the rising novelist is
readily admitted. Severely condemning the Radcliffe manner
as little better than humbug, the reviewer speaks of Mr.
Murphy’s adherence to it with disapproval and regret:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Amid these flat imitations of the Castle of Udolpho we
lighted unexpectedly upon the work which is the subject of the present
article, and, in defiance of the very bad taste in which it is composed,
we found ourselves insensibly involved in the perusal, and
at times impressed with no common degree of respect for the powers
of the author. We have at no time more earnestly desired to extend
our voice to a bewildered traveller, than towards this young man,
whose taste is so inferior to his powers of imagination and expression,
that we never saw a more remarkable instance of genius degraded
by the labour in which it is employed. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; He possesses a strong
and vigorous fancy, with great command of language. He has indeed
regulated his incidents upon those of others, and therefore added
to the imperfections which we have pointed out, the want of originality.
But his feeling and conception of character are his own,
and from these we judge of his powers. In truth we rose from his
strange chaotic novel romance as from a confused and feverish
dream, unrefreshed, and unamused, yet strongly impressed by many
of the ideas which had been so vaguely and wildly presented to our
imagination.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>This article was to become of the greatest consequence
to Maturin’s literary career, and will be returned to further on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Family of Montorio</i> brought to its author nothing more
substantial than fame in his nearest environs, for, notwithstanding
the pseudonym, it was universally attributed to
Maturin.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> His income thus remained as scanty as ever,
whilst his family kept on increasing; his son William Basil,
afterwards a well-known member of the Irish Church, was
born in July 1807. Nonetheless Maturin resolved to try
his luck once more and produced, in 1808, a romance titled
<i>The Wild Irish Boy</i>. This time his task was executed under
circumstances peculiarly embarrassing; harassed by clamouring
duties in every direction, Maturin was often forced
to ‘borrow from the hours of night to complete his story.’<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
The book was intended, more directly than most of his
productions, to bring in some remuneration and by every
means to attract the attention of the reading public. Its
very title was chosen with a view to exciting curiosity,
suggesting a counterpart to Lady Morgan’s (then Miss Owenson’s)
story of <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i>, which had appeared the
previous year and proved an eminent success. Another
attempt in the same direction was a lengthy dedication to
Lord Moira<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;written in very bad taste and containing
the hopeful assurance that the work in hand would now
determine whether the author possesses talent or no; for,
if he does, the book cannot fail to secure his lordship’s notice.
At the same time Maturin was fully aware that his talent
was here by no means displayed to its advantage. <i>Montorio</i>
was written in a spirit which he felt to be his special power;
<i>The Wild Irish Boy</i> was calculated to please all&mdash;except
the author himself. That the audience appealed to was
not the most cultivated part of the public is rather candidly
alluded to in the preface. Maturin states that his head is
full of his country, but that he can perforce not give vent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to his thoughts, being compelled to resort to other material,
better relished by the public:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The fashionable materials for novel-writing I know to be, a
lounge in Bond-street, a phaeton-tour in the Park, a masquerade
with appropriate scenery, and a birth-day or birth-night, with dresses
and decorations, accurately copied from the newspapers.</p>

<p>He who writes with an hope of being read, must write something
like this. I say must, because this species of writing, not exacting
a sacrifice of principles, but of taste, the public have reasonably a
right to dictate in. He who would prostitute his morals, is a monster,
he who sacrifices his inclinations and habits of writing, is&mdash;an
author.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is desirable to look forward to the time,
when independence, acquired without any sacrifice of integrity,
will enable a man to consult only himself in the choice and mode
of his subject. He who is capable of writing a good novel, ought
to feel that he was born for a higher purpose than writing novels.</p>
</div>

<p>From the last sentence it has, naturally enough, been
inferred that Maturin entertained but a mean opinion of
novel-writing. Yet his prefaces cannot be taken literally.
The tone of apology which, more or less, pervades nearly
all of them, is much akin to the passing humility following
close upon the heels of intoxication; and as prefaces are
always composed after the conclusion of the respective
works, these were written in moments of weariness attendant
upon great mental exertion and extravagant sallies
of imagination. Maturin was not lacking in literary ambition,
nor did his poetical vein ever flow more richly than
during his short period of, not exactly independence, but
something like tolerable circumstances. His unfavourable
judgment of novel-writing, in the present case, was probably
due to the fact that he was not himself pleased with
<i>The Wild Irish Boy</i>.</p>

<p>This, of course, is no excuse for the book, which indeed
shows inferior work to a degree truly astonishing. Were
it not for certain episodes where genuine power is displayed,
and for the fact that the book was entirely a work of imagination,
without any hidden aims of personal import&mdash;it
would not fall very short of that species of composition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the producers of which Maturin once characterized<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> as
‘infamous and ephemeral scribblers, who pander for the
public lust after anecdote that vilify the great, debase the
illustrious, and expose the unfortunate, under the titles
of a Winter, a Month, or six Weeks at the metropolis or
some place of public resort.’ <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i> is brimful
of august personages, lords and ladies, represented in a most
unfavourable light, distorted and exaggerated by the feverish
imagination of one who knew nothing of his subject.
The fashionable world is condemned as sinful and utterly
demoralizing, high life consists but of high vices, described
and investigated from every side; while the kind of pure,
old-fashioned, religious, home-like existence that is recommended
as its contrast, is not found interesting enough to
be illustrated otherwise than by very imperfect glimpses.
Extravagant as the tone is, it becomes perfectly absurd
when the moralist comes into conflict with the patriot.
The author appears to have feared that the feelings of the
public whose taste he is trying to gratify, might be offended
by too much abuse of the British aristocracy&mdash;the pride
of the nation!&mdash;and occasionally the tendency bursts
into quite an opposite direction. The young fool of a hero&mdash;whose
autobiography the book represents&mdash;has been painting
the whole lot in the blackest of dyes, indulging in the
grossest of dissipations and capable of the most contemptible
baseness; yet once, seeing them all collected at a royal
birth-day, he hits upon comparing them to the ‘courtiers’ of
Napoleon&mdash;whom he has never beheld&mdash;with the result
that he is ‘elated with confidence, with exultation, with
pride,’ and feels satisfied that the English upper ten yet
‘loved their king, and worshipped their God,’ and, with many
vices, ‘yet were the first on earth in national virtues.’
The sense of national superiority in the English public is
flattered by a sweeping condemnation of everything foreign&mdash;it
is clear that the glorification of <i>Ireland</i> must consequently
be rather loose and rhapsodical&mdash;; especially are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
all Frenchmen and -women represented as monsters of malignity
and immorality, and Voltaire and Rousseau mentioned
with Puritan abhorrence. It was in vogue at that time
to introduce into a ‘fashionable’ novel discussions about
the leading writers of the day, and this duty is also carefully
fulfilled. These passages are to be considered among
the most interesting in the book, although they have no
bearing upon the story proper. Among wicked writers who
corrupt both taste and morals are Goethe (<i>Werther</i>), Godwin,
and Mary Wollstonecraft. Miss Edgeworth, on the
other hand, is enthusiastically lauded as the author of <i>Belinda</i>.
It is curious to see Maturin here defy the mental
parents of his own production, and make ineffectual efforts
to free himself from that which has, even in the present
work, too strong a hold upon him: without Rousseau and
<i>Werther</i> the opening chapters of <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i>, containing
a series of letters from a young lady attached to the hero
in a thoroughly romantic fashion, would never have been
written; whereas there is not a single page for which Miss
Edgeworth would have been willing to take the responsibility.
As for Godwin, he was of all the writers of the age the
one who exercised the strongest influence upon Maturin’s
work.&mdash;The purity of the manners and descriptions of
Southey is gratefully admitted, while the literary qualities
of his epics are subjected to vigorous criticism, very uncommon
at the time, but agreed to by the judgment of posterity.
The <i>Anacreon</i> of Moore, as might be expected, does not
escape censure. The following passage is an example of
the nonsensical style which prevails in the book; it is uttered
by a boy of eighteen, who has just been cured of a desperate
passion for his own mother-in-law:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I speak of him (Moore) with real sorrow: he might have done
much, he has done nothing, but what I hope he will yet wish undone.
&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; for the attempt to communicate what he must have felt
the injuries of himself, for the attempt to add seduction to pleasure,
and teach impurity a new system of sentimental logic, to add
an impulse to the lapse of vitious feeling, and modulate the <i>death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
dance</i> of vice with the harmony of a lyre strung by heaven; for
this&mdash;there is, there can be no excuse, even at the bar of literature;
and if he carries the cause to an higher court, I doubt still more
tremblingly his acquittal there.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>But the story, involved as it is, remains to be told. The
book opens with a letter to one Miss Elmaide St. Clair from
an old maiden aunt, who, possessing some knowledge of
her niece’s character and the pernicious tendencies of the
age, warns her against false sensibility and fancies too romantic.
Then follow the letters of Elmaide herself, who at once
informs her correspondent (not the aunt) that the admonitory
epistle was received too late: she is already, and irrevocably,
in the fetters of a romantic attachment to the hero,
a young man, almost a boy, whose wild and dissipated
habits the whole of Dublin is talking of. She is fully persuaded
of the hopelessness of her case, understanding that he
suffers himself to be led into such a mode of life in order
to forget an unfortunate love-story of his own, the subject
of which is a woman living at present somewhere in Western
Ireland. That woman is widely celebrated for</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>fashionable folly and vice, without an equal or rival, till her
reign was extended over subjects of a second generation, whose
beauty triumphed over nature, and whose wit is unimpaired by time,
whose sons have entered into public life, whose daughters have
married, whose grand children form a numerous family already,
and whose beauty is still as distant from decline as from competition.</p>
</div>

<p>The retirement of Lady Montrevor&mdash;such is her name&mdash;has
taken place under extraordinary circumstances. Her
husband, a statesman of much influence, has illegally held
the title and fortunes of the earldom of Westhampton
for thirty years; at last the legitimate heir, long pursued
and oppressed by the usurper, has made his appearance
and laid claim to his own. To the usurper naught else
remained but the title of Montrevor and his Irish estates,
whither his lady, who was wholly ignorant of the story,
has accompanied him. Here the hero of the tale has met
her and subsequently become fatally infatuated; he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
then been sent to Dublin in the company of a relation who
introduces to him that class of pleasure which now forms
the torture of Miss St. Clair. Her correspondence ends with
the intelligence that he has unexpectedly set out for the West.</p>

<p>Now the hero, whose name is Ormsby Bethel, rises to
speak. It appears that he has returned to the neighbourhood
of Dublin and lives somewhere on the coast. Miss St. Clair,
happening to move near the place, hits upon the expedient
of leaving anonymous letters addressed to him, in a recess
amongst the rocks where he is in the habit of strolling. In
these she requests him to tell her all about his life. He
complies and places letters for her in the same recess.</p>

<p>This is mentioned in letters from the parties concerned,
but at this point the story itself commences: an autobiography
of the hero, written to an un-named friend, which
he begins by the narrative he has written to Miss St. Clair.</p>

<p>His birth and childhood are involved in a deep mystery.
Born in France, he has faint reminiscences of having been
hurried from place to place, until, at the age of seven, he is
taken to London and committed to the care of an old and
wealthy couple. Here he also visits a school, where he
enters into friendship with a boy called Hammond, who
subsequently plays a certain part in his story. One day
he hears his father mentioned and after this knows no rest;
his health declines, and he is sent to a parson in Cumberland,
where he pursues his studies and improves both in
mind and body. His stay here is interrupted by a message
from his father, who announces his desire that Ormsby is
to set out for Ireland and forthwith to graduate at the
University of Dublin; from his father’s letter Ormsby learns
that he is illegitimate. After having spent some time in
the Irish capital, he is summoned to join the family in the
West. He travels there with his father’s confidential servant,
a Frenchman, from whose very impious conversation
he gathers that his father is a worn-out libertine. Mr. Bethel
is, indeed, a wretched invalid, who is constantly tormented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
by the memories of pleasures he has lost the power to enjoy,
and who regards his son with feelings of envy because of
his youth and strength. The rest of the family consists
of his daughter Sybilla, a gentle and pure-minded girl, and
her gouvernante, a Miss Perceval, an atheist and admirer
of French writers; one episode occurring in the family life
is that Miss Perceval tries to prevent Sybilla from reading
the Bible, and would even be on a fair way to succeed but
for the intervention of Ormsby. Among his neighbours
he finds his school-fellow Hammond, whose father, an old
drunkard, owns an estate in the vicinity. The most remarkable
person there, however, is an elder brother of Mr. Bethel,
called De Lacy. He leads a life in the style of an ancient
Irish chieftain, but, unlike most ‘Milesians’ he is rich, and
Ormsby at once becomes his favourite and heir-apparent.&mdash;Upon
this the Montrevors put in their appearance, and turn
all the country upside down with their splendid fêtes and
assemblies. Ormsby has been interested in the brilliant
and unhappy Lady Montrevor even before he has seen her,
and when he actually meets her he is perfectly overwhelmed
by her attractions. Her husband, for his part, only expects
to be called back to England as soon as his recent scandal
has been forgotten and his talents and influence are required
again. Meanwhile he employs his time in canvassing votes
for his son, and pretends, to that end, to be intent upon proposing
all sorts of reforms and improvements for Ireland.
There is no love lost between him and his lady, who, in
opposition to his suavity and courteousness, treats her neighbours
with capricious ridicule. Among their younger children
there is Miss Athanasia Montolieu, whose French gouvernante
is doing her utmost to corrupt the soul of her
charge with the literature of her country.&mdash;The whirl of
pleasures comes soon to a tragical end as far as the Bethel
family is concerned. One night Miss Perceval insists on
following Ormsby and his sister to a grand entertainment
given by Lord Montrevor in some public place. Ormsby is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
sitting with Lady Montrevor and her daughter, when a
gentleman approaches and requests the ladies to allow him
to escort them away from the place, the house being unfit
for them, as there is a woman present who is the mistress
of Mr. Bethel; she is recognized by the speaker himself
and another gentleman, with whom she has formerly been
on intimate terms. A violent scene ensues, and the fête is
broken up. The following morning Ormsby receives a visit
from a relative who confirms his worst doubts, namely,
that Miss Perceval is not only the mistress of his father, but
is also Ormsby’s and Sybilla’s mother. He declares that
a duel seems inevitable, but that Ormsby is disgraced for
ever if he takes part in it; the consequences must fall upon
his father, whose age and feeble health may, perhaps, excuse
him from sending a challenge. Ormsby is convinced of the
justness of his argument and keeps away the whole day,
but on returning he sees the thoughtlessness of his conduct.
His father, greatly astonished at his absence, <i>has</i> been
engaged in a duel, burst a blood-vessel, and now lies dying.
His uncle, the old Milesian, who is also convinced that
Ormsby has refused to fight a duel, has disowned him and
forbidden him his presence. Miss Perceval has taken refuge
in the house of the adversary in the recent duel, her former
acquaintance. Upon Ormsby falls the painful duty of
taking her off by main force, but, incorrigible as she is,
she flees and takes with her the greater part of Sybilla’s
money. Fortunately, Sybilla has been secretly married to
Hammond, but as his father, too, leads a life which the son
must blush for, he cannot take her to his home; he succeeds,
however, in procuring her a refuge elsewhere. Ormsby,
standing now alone in the world, resolves to leave the
country, yet an unexpected event changes his plans.&mdash;In
a solitary tower in the neighbourhood lives a mysterious
person who never speaks to or visits any one except the
poor, whose misery he endeavours to relieve. The night
Ormsby prepares to depart he is stopped by the stranger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
and exhorted to save his uncle. His striking manner induces
Ormsby to yield to his exhortations; he hastens to the
castle of the Milesian and arrives just in time to save the old
man from the hands of a murderer. Upon this a reconciliation
takes place. Ormsby is again acknowledged as the
heir of his uncle, and the castle becomes his home. His
hopeless attachment to Lady Montrevor, however, makes
him profoundly unhappy, and at length his uncle sends
him to Dublin in company with the relative who gave him
the ill-fated advice about the duel. In Dublin his life is
what the letters of Miss St. Clair, in the beginning of the
story, indicate with so much pain. His disappearance, the
mention of which puts an end to her correspondence, is
caused by the news that his uncle has been arrested for
Ormsby’s debts. Ill as he is, he sets off on his journey in
a delirious condition, is once more forgiven by the old man
and sent back near the capital where, as has been told, he
begins to write down his recollections to his unknown correspondent,
Miss St. Clair.&mdash;In a letter to his uncle Ormsby
confesses that the cause of his dejection may be traced to
Montrevor-House, in answer to which the old man summons
him back, informing him that he has ‘worked wonders’
in his favour. Though unable to understand the meaning
hidden in his uncle’s message, Ormsby sets out for the castle
of Montrevor and, on arriving there is, first of all, greeted
by the Milesian who draws forward Miss Athanasia Montolieu
and places her hand in Ormsby’s. It occurs to Ormsby
that this, in fact, was the only rational way of interpreting
his letter, but now it is too late for any explanation. He is
married that very night; Lord Montrevor, whose star has
re-risen in England, entertains the intention of immediately
returning there with all his family. Shortly afterwards the
old Milesian dies, leaving Ormsby in possession of a large
fortune.&mdash;The rest of the story is mainly a fulfilment of
what was promised in the preface. The company is divided
between Bond-street and fashionable entertainments, most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
of which are held within the family-circle. Lord and Lady
Montrevor have several daughters, one of whom has, strangely
enough, married the present Earl of Westhampton&mdash;an
uneducated man of blunt manners&mdash;whom her father
has treated so infamously. The principal amusement at
these entertainments, aside from questionable gallantries,
are cards, at which they attempt to rob and even cheat
each other. Ormsby before long gambles away every shilling
of his property as well as of that of his wife, and once
more he comes face to face with ruin. A depraved woman
of fashion, Lady Delphina Orberry, the greatest enemy of
Lady Montrevor, falls violently in love with him. Ormsby,
who fortunately has become amorous of his own wife, is
insensible to attentions of this character, yet Lady Orberry
contrives to become his sole creditor, thus to get him, economically
at least, at her mercy. Lady Montrevor, at this
time, contemplates a retirement from the world altogether.
She has met a man who has loved her in her youth, before
she was a woman of fashion, and whom she wantonly rejected;
now they discover their feelings to be unchanged. The situation,
however, becomes acute in the extreme, when Lord
Montrevor, who hates his wife, determines to prosecute
Ormsby for adultery with her, and appearances are against
them. Lady Montrevor attempts to commit suicide; Ormsby
bursts into her room, and tears the laudanum from her, upon
which, it is said, ‘all recollection forsakes him.’ When he
regains his self-possession, all complications are quickly
and wonderfully unravelled. Lady Delphina Orberry takes
poison and dies, confessing to Ormsby that she had a daughter
who was educated in Ireland in separation from her mother;
she gives him some letters whence it appears that her
name was Elmaide St. Clair. Lord Montrevor falls in a
duel, his wife becoming thus free to unite herself with the
lover of her youth. The <i>dramatis personæ</i> once more retire
to Ireland, for Lady Montrevor’s lover turns out to be the
identical inhabitant of the solitary tower, and, still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
strange, the father of Ormsby, a third brother of De Lacy
and Mr. Bethel. Miss Perceval had been his mistress shortly
before she became Mr. Bethel’s, and Ormsby was believed
to be the son of the latter. Ormsby’s affairs are forthwith
cleared up. It appears that the often-mentioned relative,
who has been his agent, has secretly hated him because of
the frustration of his hopes of becoming De Lacy’s heir himself,
and thus he has been trying to rob Ormsby of his property
and, moreover, to seduce his wife; but so far from
succeeding in his designs, he has, at last, shot himself. Athanasia
now presents Ormsby with a child, and the book ends
with this paradoxical sentence: ‘Let those who cannot
feel my felicity, attempt to describe it.’&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the short <i>précis</i> above it ought to be evident that
the story is diffuse and clumsily constructed; that it contains
certain good suggestions that are not made the most
of, and cleverly built-up situations which lead to platitudes
or are forcibly and implausibly dissolved. The cause of
this, no doubt, may be traced to the manifold and contradictory
considerations Maturin imagined himself to be
bound to observe while writing his second book. The autobiography
does not attach itself quite naturally to the correspondence
that precedes it, and the intrigue, when it once
commences, is continually interrupted by discussions and
episodes. From the latter, however, is to be sought what
interest the book is capable of arousing. The correspondence
of Miss St. Clair is, in itself, an instance worthy of note. It
has been admired by a critic<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> for ‘its method of pure suggestion
of character without incident;’ and the character
revealed is that of a heroine typically romantic.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Her
love is soft and dreaming, made to live on sighs and tears,
too platonic and ethereal even for the vicinity of its object:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But he has seen me, and has felt, as if he looked on vacancy;
and it is better, much better so. I can hardly bear his sight, I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
not bear his voice speaking to me; his rich and angel tones would
madden me; no, I cannot woo him. I will hide myself in the solitude
of pride and despair. Perhaps when he treads on my grave,
he may pause, he may ask&mdash;Oh! let him not, let him not; shall
I not rest in a grave?</p>
</div>

<p>This self-denying feeling, it is seen, has reached a degree
where every positive aspiration ends. The writer is herself
aware that she leaves far behind her the sentimental novels
she has read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They never loved who wished to be near what they loved. Werther
talks of dancing with Charlotte, of holding her in his arms; what
feelings men have! Such a time is with me, a time of fear and
blindness. I love to be so far from him, that it is requisite for me
to watch and devise how I may catch a glance or a tone from him.
I would not be nearer if I might; a glance, a tone is enough, is too
much for me.</p>
</div>

<p>The story of Elmaide St. Clair is given as a warning
example of overwrought sensibility and its fatal consequences,
and it might be supposed that this quality in her
is, therefore, deliberately exaggerated. Yet that part of the
book, most of all, impresses the reader with the genuineness
of its conception; it is written with obvious inspiration,
and there is absolutely nothing of parody about the style.
It is one of the few instances where the author seems to
be in perfect sympathy with his subject, and he actually
excels in the very kind of composition he at the same time
pretends to condemn.&mdash;Another of the better episodes
is neither romantic nor ‘fashionable,’ but foreshadows Maturin’s
best attainments in realistic description of ordinary
life of a certain kind. Whether it was an individual trait
of Maturin, or whether it belongs to the Irish temperament&mdash;few
English writers have displayed so intense a horror of
a narrow, monotonous existence without any sort of excitement
or interest. In <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i>, in <i>Women</i>, in
<i>Melmoth</i>, this aversion is expressed more and more powerfully
each time. In the present work this feeling is given
an outlet in the case of the old couple in London, with whom
Ormsby is placed while a child. They have retired from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
business in order to pass the remainder of their days in
quietness; but instead of enjoying an agreeable rest, they
are seized by an intolerable tedium, and by and by their
life, as it were, develops into a stagnant pool:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The morning was passed by Mr. Sampson in examining books
of obsolete accounts, which he had brought with him from the city
“against a rainy day,” as he said in totting up sums, whose numbers
he could by that time tell blindfold, and when he had found the
amount, yawning and beginning again; sometimes he strolled about
the house, examined locks that did not want repairing, shook his
head at the weather-glass, and projected a removal of the clock
from behind the parlour door, where its ticking made him melancholy
after dinner. His wife retired to her room, examined the
contents of old drawers, discovered that things grew yellow by lying
by, and resolved to expose them to the sun some day in the following
week; at a certain hour she visited the kitchen, watched the
intrusion of strange cats, and detected the turnspit in his many
contrivances to escape from duty, by which she boasted, dinner
was prevented from being five minutes later than the time. They
dined early without appetite, and retired early without drowsiness;
sometimes a walk was proposed, on the appearance of a fine morning,
but then the weather-glass was examined, till the time for walking
had passed away; and looking wistfully at each other, they sunk
into their easy chairs, and counted how many minutes till dinner.</p>
</div>

<p>The great bulk of the book, as has been said, aspires to
treat of modern life in higher circles, of which Maturin,
at the time, knew little or nothing. The descriptions, consequently,
lack all atmosphere of reality, nor does the characterization
augment the value of the whole. The worst of it all
is that the hero is so uninteresting, and does not in the
least fulfil the expectations roused by the effusions of
Elmaide St. Clair. A very self-exulting tone is generally
not in keeping with an autobiographical form, yet Ormsby
Bethel does nothing to suppress the eulogies lavishly bestowed
on him by well-meaning people, eulogies which he certainly
does not deserve. He calls himself wild, but wildness
is merely an embellishing name for weakness; there is
nothing in him of real, refreshing wildness, or youthful
recklessness; he is always in an unnatural state of exaltation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
either of virtue or repentance. A preacher of morals and
defender of religion as he aspires to be in a society that
cares for neither, he displays, when emergency arises, no
more strength of mind than his neighbours. What is it
but a deplorable weakness in a man to publish about himself
the letters of Elmaide St. Clair on the pretence that
they treat of a period of his life of which he ‘could not speak
in the first person?’ It is very doubtful whether Ormsby
Bethel ever became popular among the public of circulating
libraries. That the reader cannot feel sympathy for the
hero is, of course, in itself no fault in a book, but in this
case it is only too evident that it is the author’s intention
he should.&mdash;The wholly imaginary character of Lady
Montrevor is too superlative and violently exaggerated, and
her wonderful accomplishments, of mind and body, are endlessly
repeated in a most extravagant language. Her daughter
Athanasia is more interesting; she is one of those delicate
and ethereal beings Maturin always succeeded in designing,
and of which there are no two quite alike. Athanasia
is, like Byron’s Aurora,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">&mdash;a fair and fairy one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the best class, and better than her class<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and, like her, she is also in possession of a portion of common
sense and strength of mind, being eventually cured of the
malady under which Elmaide St. Clair breaks down. At first,
indeed, her case seems desperate. She is grown up into
an ‘early, and exquisite, and dangerous maturity;’ she has
been educated ‘without example but of vice and folly,’ and
left to form her ideas from improper literature, until she is
‘dying to be the heroine of a mad and wicked tale of a Rousseau,
of a Goethe, of a Wolstonecraft.’ And to become
such a heroine she imagines it necessary for her to have
both a husband and a lover. Therefore she encourages the
attentions of the relative of her husband, who otherwise is
quite indifferent to her. Yet at the bottom of her heart
there is a yearning for fidelity, honourable love and quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
happiness, and when difficulties are gathering around her
husband, this yearning grows stronger and stronger. At
last she understands that the duties of life differ greatly
from those of romance, and in a candid and touching letter&mdash;which
her husband reads while she is sleeping!&mdash;she
renounces the relative for ever. Now this argumentation
would be very well if the aforesaid writers actually <i>did</i>
maintain the views ascribed to them; but it is unquestionably
a very childish way of understanding them to long
for a forbidden attachment even in case you happen to be
united to the man you love. Considering that Athanasia
has grown up in an environment so corrupt as Maturin
tries to depict it, it is certainly too far-fetched to throw
the blame upon Julie and Charlotte. Yet it is never explicitly
stated that Athanasia has misconceived what she
has read; the opinions pass as those of the author. This
curious anti-romantic freak of Maturin, whatever its cause,
was not of long duration: eight years later accusations of
the same kind were brought against himself, in connection
with his tragedy of <i>Bertram</i>.&mdash;Among the secondary characters
in the book that of Lady Delphina Orberry has been
pointed out<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> as representing ‘a type of woman rare in
English fiction.’ She is introduced as a rival of Lady Montrevor
and is her contrast in every respect; her weapons
against that lady’s dazzling brilliancy and sparkling wit
are ‘soft, seducing manners,’ a ‘timid silence,’ and ‘melting
whispers.’ Behind, however, this unterrifying exterior there
is a mind totally depraved, whereas the heart of Lady Montrevor
is discovered to have remained uncorrupted, in spite
of her position in society. Undoubtedly how Lady Orberry
clings to Ormsby like something too soft for him to shake
off, gently but irresistingly involving her fate with his, is
well described, and how she understands to excite his compassion
by representing herself as unjustly suspected of
that which she most wishes, in her relation to him. But
the end, again, is forced and unnatural; it is only because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the hero <i>must</i> be got out of his difficulties that she takes
poison, confesses all her crimes to him, and gives him the
letters of her unhappy daughter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Notwithstanding all that can be said against <i>The Wild
Irish Boy</i>, it is of considerable interest in Maturin’s earlier
production, when regarded as a kind of preparatory study
to <i>Women</i>, one of his masterpieces. Many of the characters
and situations present obvious similarities, and it will, therefore,
be necessary later on to refer to the present work.
A few words are still required to define its character as
an Irish novel, one of the first where elements typically
Irish are brought forward.</p>

<p>Anything finished or complete these Irish ingredients
do not form; that Maturin longed to speak of his country
but felt himself prevented by other considerations has already
been pointed out. Of the attempts to treat of Ireland, her
past and present, only some diffuse discussions remain here
and there, without being naturally introduced into the story.
The first idea of Ireland is introduced in a surprising and
poetical way. During his solitary wanderings in the mountains
of Cumberland, in his earliest youth, Ormsby sometimes
amuses himself by imagining a people whose destinies
he is to lead and whose sovereign and benefactor he is to
become:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; imagined them possessed of the most shining qualities
that can enter into the human character, glowing with untaught
affections, and luxuriant with uncultivated virtue; but proud,
irritable, impetuous, indolent and superstitious; conscious of claims
they knew not how to support, burning with excellencies, which,
because they wanted regulation, wanted both dignity and utility;
and disgraced by crimes which the moment after their commission
they lamented, as a man laments the involuntary outrages of drunkenness.
I imagined a people that seemed to stretch out its helpless
hands, like the infant Moses from the ark, and promise its preserver
to bless and dignify the species.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>These fancies he discloses to the good parson, his tutor,
who immediately answers that he has ‘accurately described
the Irish nation.’ Shortly afterwards Ormsby is sent to
Ireland. He might now be expected to come into some
contact with the people of his dreams, but this material is,
unfortunately, allowed to run to waste. His first stay in
Dublin is occupied by a tedious discourse upon the University,
and by a description of a Calvinistic set among the
students, who endeavour to draw Ormsby into their circle.
In Maturin’s days these passages possibly might have excited
some local interest, yet to a modern reader they form a most
unexhilarating digression, from the like of which all other
works of Maturin are exempt. Ormsby’s second sojourn
at Dublin, that which he otherwise avoids speaking of in
the first person, contains a lengthy comparison between
the Irish and English character. This is somewhat more
to the point; but even at that time, when but little had
been written about the former, observations of this kind
were hardly original:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Irish are more ardent lovers, the English better husbands.
The Irishman is more exhilarating in society, the Englishman’s
comforts are more domestic. One is formed to give more delight,
the other more tranquil and rational happiness to life. The Irishman
approaches you with facility and attaches himself to you with ardor;
the Englishman it is difficult to conciliate as an acquaintance, and
more difficult to obtain for a friend, but once obtained, the prize
is beyond all labor.</p>
</div>

<p>Now and then the political state of Ireland is mentioned:
‘her depressed trade, her neglected populace, her renegade
nobility, her dissipated, and careless, and unnational gentry’&mdash;but
almost always in the form of a discourse, apart from
the story. Events and personages throwing light upon the
state of Ireland and her national character, are not allowed
to speak for themselves; when the discourse is finished,
the reader again finds himself in the drawing-room of Lady
Montrevor. In a few instances only the descriptions present
a glimpse of Irish life freed from comment. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
a dinner-party at the house of the elder Hammond, of a
riotous and disorderly character, the account of which,
a note informs us, is taken from real life. The other is an
instance of so-called ‘paddyism,’ unique in the production
of Maturin who, unlike most older Irish novelists, was not at
all fond of depicting the lower classes with sympathetic
humour. The night the Montrevors arrive at their castle,
the tenantry are gathered to receive them, having shortened
the tedium of waiting by indulging in a drop of whiskey,
with the result that the approaching family are hailed with
an Irish cry that frightens their horses and endangers their
very lives. Their intentions were all the best, as is explained
by an old man:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But as we were all tenants to this great new lord, and old followers
to the family, though they never lived among us, why we all
loved him as we did our eyes, though we never set them upon his
face till last night. So we thought it would be but right to go out
and give him a shout of joy, when he was coming to his own house,
that he never was in before; and we all set out, and we were early
enough to see him, for the devil a bit of him was there, and so says
I to them, there’s no good at all in waiting to see a man in the dark,
and we are perished standing here in the bog, with nothing to warm
us but the rain and wind; and so let us step into Paddy Donnellan’s
that is within a step of the gate, and take a drop of whiskey, and
when we hear the carriage wheel, we’ll all come out as fresh as daisies,
and give him an Irish cry that he never heard from them English
spalpeens in his life.</p>
</div>

<p>This is one of the preludes to the innumerable scenes
of Irish boisterousness and characteristic blunders, found
in the pages of later writers, Carleton, Lover, Lever, and
others.</p>

<p>The ancient glory of Ireland is touched upon in the figure
of the old Milesian.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The type had been introduced into
fiction by Miss Owenson; her story of <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i>
is the first patriotic Irish novel of a predominantly romantic
colouring, and essentially influenced, as will be seen, Maturin’s
third book. It is an immature and extravagant, but
not undelightful tale of an Irish chieftain, the prince of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Inismore, whose ancestors, in the Cromwellian wars, lost
nearly all their estates to an English soldier, the same estates
still being in possession of the English soldier’s descendants.
The present prince of Inismore lives in solitary retirement
with his chaplain and his daughter, a beautiful, gifted and
accomplished young lady, whose only ‘wildness’ is her
naturalness of manners and purity of heart. The head of
the English family has made several attempts at reconciliation,
his advances having always been proudly rejected.
Nevertheless both he and his son visit the prince without
revealing their identity, at the same time also concealing
their respective visits from each other; both succeed in securing
the friendship of the old man, and both fall in love
with his daughter. A tragedy is avoided by the father
voluntarily retiring and leaving to his son the girl and all
his Irish estates. This intrigue, however, is merely a setting
for the real tendency of the story, which is to make Ireland
known. The colloquies held at Castle Inismore form the
principal part of the book; they treat exclusively of the
past of Ireland and are furnished with notes and quotations
from Walker, Ware, Young, and other historians, all tending
to prove the oriental descent and great antiquity of
the Milesian race, its attachment to poetry and music, as
well as its other noble qualities and high standard of civilization
at a very early period.</p>

<p>In spite of its promising title, Maturin’s second book
contains no loans from <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i> except the venerable
Milesian with his inevitable <i>chapelain de maison</i>, and
even this figure has undergone a change. De Lacy is a rich
man who has travelled much in foreign parts and is, in every
way, more modern and less romantic than the prince of
Inismore. The latter always appears in a dress ‘strictly
conformable to the ancient costume of the Irish nobles;’
De Lacy wears ‘the English habit of fifty years ago,’ with
only an Irish cloak to remind one of his nationality. But
their notions of their race and their country are the same,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
De Lacy also assuring us that ‘he who shakes my belief in
the antiquity of my country, must first shake my belief in
the beatitude of the immaculate Virgin Mary.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Wild Irish Boy</i> appears to have met with the very
fate Maturin had hoped to avoid by trying to please all:
it attracted but little attention, or, if the statement of a
writer<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is to be relied upon, that the book was ‘admired,
talked of, praised,’ the attention probably was confined
to the literary circles of Dublin. In dedicating his third
book to the ‘Quarterly Reviewers’ Maturin says that they
had been pleased to notice his romance of <i>Montorio</i>, but
there are no indications of his second book having been
subject to public review. As a means of brightening the
economic outlook of its author, <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i> failed
completely; it was, like <i>Montorio</i>, published at his own
risk, and the success was not distinct enough to induce any
publisher to purchase the copyright. Discouraged from an
immediate renewal of the attempt, Maturin, for four years
to come, devoted his leisure hours exclusively to some less
precarious occupation, which, in all probability, consisted
in the enlargement of and still closer attention to his boarding-school.
What support he might hitherto have had
from his father now also ceased, for about 1810 Maturin
senior was dismissed from his situation. One biographer,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
alluding to this deplorable event, says that Charles Robert
was ‘roused to poetry by disappointment,’ which would antedate
the event in question by about 5 years. There seems,
however, to be more reason to believe Alaric Watts, who,
writing in 1819, states that William Maturin was dismissed
after a service of 47 years, adding the following particulars:
‘The day of his dismissal he was pennyless: it is singular,
that though the commissioners of inquiry, who sat repeatedly
on the business pronounced this unfortunate gentleman
wholly innocent of the charge (of fraud) brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
against him, he has been suffered to linger for nine years
since, without redress, without relief, and without notice.’
Whether this be correct or not, there is no further intelligence
about Mr. William Maturin; but in any case his last
years must have cast a gloom over all the family, and exercised
a further pressure upon the toiling life of his son.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1810 appeared Scott’s critique on <i>Montorio</i>, ending
with this passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If the author &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; be indeed, as he describes himself, young
and inexperienced, without literary friend or counsellor, we earnestly
exhort him to seek one on whose taste and judgment he may rely.
He is now, like an untutored colt, wasting his best vigour in irregular
efforts without either grace or object; but there is much of these
volumes which promises a career that may at some future time
astonish the public.</p>
</div>

<p>As Maturin had, somehow or other, come to know who
this friendly reviewer was, he availed himself of the opportunity
to write to Scott and solicit him to become his literary
friend and counsellor. This gave rise to an intimate, lifelong
correspondence, during the course of which Scott faithfully
assisted the poor Irishman with good advice and,
sometimes, even in a more substantial way. His epistolary
intimacy with the great novelist Maturin always counted
among his greatest distinctions, and although the two men
never met, their friendship continued warm and sincere
until Maturin’s death.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>There are no more details available with regard to Maturin’s
life at that period, but he was undoubtedly successful
in his vocation as a teacher, for when he again turned to
literature, he did so in rather a hopeful state of mind. His
biographer<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> says that when Maturin was writing <i>The
Milesian Chief</i>&mdash;which was published in the beginning
of 1812&mdash;his genius was ‘elastic and ardent, his knowledge
of composition improved with the errors of his former works
before him, and an increasing desire to do something worthy
of fame: he was at the age and under the circumstances
that are calculated to improve and correct the taste.’ Colburn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
paid 80 pounds for the copyright, which was the first
success of this kind Maturin had ever experienced; and
full of confidence he finishes his preface&mdash;in which he
does not care to enlarge upon his second book&mdash;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In my first work I attempted to explore the ground forbidden
to man; the sources of visionary terror; the “formless and the
void”: in my present I have tried the equally obscure recesses of
the human heart. If I fail in both, I shall&mdash;write again.</p>
</div>

<p>The preface is in the form of a dedication to the Quarterly
Reviewers, whom Maturin accuses of writing reviews merely
to make a display of their own cleverness and neglecting
to speak of the works they are to judge:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Seriously I read the Reviews for information, and information
I could get none&mdash;about myself. All I learned was that I was a
bad writer, but why, or how, or in what manner I was to become
better, they graciously left to myself.</p>
</div>

<p>The tone is throughout very different from that of the
preface to <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i>; herein speaks the artist
to whom a literary reputation is by no means indifferent.
Here also is found the much-quoted sentence where Maturin
defines his characteristic powers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If I possess any talent, it is that of darkening the gloomy, and
of deepening the sad; of painting life in extremes, and representing
those struggles of passion when the soul trembles on the verge of the
unlawful and the unhallowed.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the work now at hand Maturin adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the following pages I have tried to apply these powers to the
scenes of actual life: and I have chosen my own country for the
scene, because I believe it the only country on earth, where, from
the strange existing opposition of religion, politics, and manners,
the extremes of refinement and barbarism are united, and the most
wild and incredible situations of romantic story are hourly passing
before modern eyes.</p>
</div>

<p>All this material is, very likely, not attended to in <i>The
Milesian Chief</i>, yet it is certainly by far the noblest of
Maturin’s three earlier romances.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>The Milesian Chief is Connal O’Morven, a young man of
an ancient and formerly potent Irish family, now reduced to
extreme poverty. Their castle and estates have been sold
to an Englishman, Lord Montclare, and Connal lives with
his aged and insane grandfather in a ruined watch-tower,
subsisting chiefly on memories of bygone glory. The old
man, in his frantic rage against England, conceives a plan
of insurrection, for the liberation of Ireland; and Connal,
young and inexperienced as he is, engages himself to be
the leader of it. In the meantime Miss Armida Fitzalban,
the daughter of Lord Montclare, whose beauty and talents
have struck all Europe with amazement, arrives at the
castle, and a violent passion flames up between her and
Connal. Fully comprehending the impossibility of success
in his enterprise, Connal is determined to dissolve the conspiracy,
but the treacherous conduct of Armida’s unsuccessful
lover, an English officer called Wandesford, who happens
to get wind of the plan, compels him to take up arms. Armida
renounces everything and follows Connal and his band
to a remote island on the Atlantic coast. The government
troops, however, track them even there, and as the cause
of the rebels is hopeless, Armida is conducted back to her
home. Becoming now a prey to the machinations of an unnatural
mother, she ends her days by taking poison; Connal
surrenders himself to the government and is sentenced to death.</p>

<p>By the side of this love-story there is another, equally
unhappy, but bizarre rather than gloomy, curious rather
than grand: of Connal’s younger brother Desmond, and
Armida’s younger sister Ines. The last-named, for family
reasons, is, by her mother, given out as a boy; and being
very young and innocent she never suspects her sex but
imagines herself to love Desmond as brother loves brother.
At last the secret is revealed and they are married for a
short time, but subsequently Ines is also implicated in the
schemes of her mother, and dies of a broken heart in a state
of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The destinies of these four people form the contents
of the book. It is a record of human passions which are
incalculable from the external basis upon which the incidents
take place, and the interest is absorbed by the sufferings
and inner conflicts of a few figures powerfully domineering
at the expense of the <i>milieu</i>. This is, indeed, the case
with all Maturin’s Irish stories; a dissection of the social
state of Ireland, with a comprehensive view of the different
classes, something in the style of Gerald Griffin’s well-known
tale of <i>The Collegians</i> (1828), it would hardly have been
within his capacity to create. In <i>The Milesian Chief</i> the
political state of the country and the insurrection, instead
of being the main subject of the story, form but a background
to the personal tragedy of Connal O’Morven, which
becomes only the more poignant as he fights for a cause
in which he does not believe. He is the first to comprehend
that it is ‘impossible for Ireland to subsist as an independent
country,’ and the masses he has at his disposal are
in no way calculated to heighten his confidence. The Milesian
spirit so highly admired Maturin finds only in a few
surviving descendants of the noblest families; his ideas of
the people are tinged with the somewhat aristocratic notion
which makes one of the distinctions between the typical
19th century romanticism and its pioneers in the preceding
one. In some of his sermons Maturin clearly expresses
his opinions on this point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is an absurd and mischievous prejudice that supposes the
existence of vice confined to the higher classes of life, and virtue
(as they call it) the everlasting inhabitant of a cottage&mdash;it is a
prejudice originating in utter ignorance of life, cherished by the
silly illusions of pastoral poetry, and inflamed by the wild and wicked
ravings of political enthusiasts, without any reason in nature and
in life.</p>
</div>

<p>This, it must be added, Maturin does not find to be entirely
the fault of the people:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The root of the wretchedness of the lower orders of this country
is in their depravity, and the root of their depravity is for the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
part in their ignorance; they are wicked because they are uncultivated,
and they are uncultivated because they have been shamefully,
abominably neglected; more neglected than the people of
any civilized country under heaven.</p>
</div>

<p>But much ‘sinned against’ as the lower classes are, in
the opinion of the clergyman, to the romantic they remain
unattractive; and here is the basis of the fact that the
Irish peasantry occupies, upon the whole, so inconspicuous
a place in Maturin’s production, and never&mdash;except in the
opening chapters of <i>Melmoth</i>&mdash;gives him the inspiration
to his most interesting work. On the other hand his treatment
of the subject is never undignified; if he has not
created anything like the dark and impressive pictures of
Irish rebels and outlaws found, say, in the pages of John
Banim, neither does he give way to the popular habit of
representing the Irish peasant as a cross between a fool
and a jester, which idea was so keenly resented in the Irish
literary circles in the fifties.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Yet <i>The Milesian Chief</i> must be considered, in a way,
a national tale, and it is even extremely characteristic as
such; the plot, in its roughest outlines, is the identical
one used by Irish novelists up to this day with a persistence
which cannot escape any student of Anglo-Irish literature.
These rough outlines are as follows. A person of eminence
arrives in Ireland; he (or she) possesses every qualification
for a rich and interesting life, yet nothing noteworthy has
ever happened to him, and he is full of spleen until, once
there, he is dragged into a whirl of undreamt-of adventures;
his former habits, prejudices and ways of thinking suddenly
give way to an all-absorbing passion, which irresistibly
hurries him towards bliss or destruction, as the case may be.
In the predilection of Irish novelists for an intrigue of this
description there is something more than a natural partiality
to a theme which aptly lends itself to literary aims; it is
the revenge of a subdued and oppressed country upon her
masters. In the field of fiction the conquered becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the conqueror, and the first come in as the last. Connal
O’Morven, unreal and idealized though he be, is the embodiment
of all that is great and proud in the Milesian spirit,
which spirit here subjugates the most brilliant representative
of the happier race. This, again, does not hinder Armida’s
infatuation from being quite individual in character, limited
only to the person of Connal. His princely ancestry of which
he is so proud, the ancient glory of Ireland, her poetry and
music, are all indifferent to her, and Irish scenery, in all
its grandeur, only makes her sigh for the sunny regions she
has quitted. As Connal is persuaded that he could never
be happy out of Ireland, their love is born under most unpromising
auspices, and its tragic issue is necessitated by the
circumstance of their having nothing in common.&mdash;</p>

<p>Armida and Connal&mdash;and Wandesford, too&mdash;are all
nearly related. This fact is made no mystery of, but plainly
communicated to Armida by her father, on their way to
Ireland. At the time of the ruin of the Irish family, and
upon the estates forthwith becoming the property of Lord
Montclare, his sister has married Mr. Randal O’Morven,
son of the old Milesian. The latter has never forgiven his
son, any more than Lord Montclare has forgiven his sister;
but shortly before her death Mrs O’Morven has written to
her brother and disclosed the extreme misery of their condition.
Lord Montclare has, consequently, appointed her
husband to be his land-steward, and offered her sons commissions
in the army. The younger, Desmond, has accepted
the offer, while Connal prefers to starve with his grandfather.</p>

<p>The family has, it is true, been shrouded in a real mystery,
but this also is shortly afterwards revealed by Lord
Montclare, when lying at death’s door to which he is brought
by the unexpected arrival in Ireland of the rest of the family,
whose existence Armida has been wholly ignorant of. Her
father has, long ago, contracted a marriage, having in view
the sole purpose of excluding the O’Morvens from the property,
by begetting a son. Armida, however, is the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
child remaining alive, whereupon Lord Montclare, exasperated
by his misfortunes, confines his wife in an obscure
place and spreads the report of her death; this is done
with the assistance of an Italian monk called Morosini, who
subsequently turns out to be in the service of two masters.
Before Lord Montclare has time to form another connection,
his lady is delivered of a son. Under the circumstances
he cannot acknowledge his heir without acknowledging his
imposture, and threatened and persecuted by Morosini he
flees from land to land, too feeble in courage to reveal the
secret. Wandesford&mdash;who is the son of his younger sister&mdash;is
the only person acquainted with the actual facts of the
case, and therefore Lord Montclare eagerly presses Armida
to accept his proposal. At last he is determined to give
the matter publicity in Ireland, for the consolatory reason
that in this country ‘the judgment of his character was
indifferent to him from his contempt for its inhabitants.’
Before, however, he has accomplished his purpose, his death
is caused by the sudden arrival of his family, who make
their appearance at Castle Montclare, attended by Morosini
and Desmond O’Morven. Desmond has come from Italy
by the same boat as Lady Montclare, and has had an opportunity
of saving her son from drowning, after which a very
tender friendship has sprung up between the two.&mdash;</p>

<p>The commencement of the story in Ireland is preceded
by two prologues, representing ‘Armida in Italy’ and
‘Armida in England.’ The first describes a banquet given
by Lord Montclare at Naples, where Wandesford also makes
his appearance. Armida has, for the occasion, arranged
some tableaux in which her manifold accomplishments are
dazzlingly displayed. In one of these the scene</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>represented the garden of an oriental palace: the sides filled
with flowers, whose lofty and luxuriant clusters seemed to rise above
the height of the apartment, and whose deep and sunny hues were
softened by the magic diffusion of the lights; and the perspective
terminated in an arch, beyond which was caught a view of the ruins
of Persepolis. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Armida advanced on the stage alone: she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
was in the oriental dress, and she had an instrument in her hand
resembling the lute. Wandesford gazed with astonishment: the
pale, slight, simply clad girl he had lately seen was transformed into
the most brilliant female in the world. The colour which applause
brought to her cheek mantled richly through the tinge of rouge she
had put on to conceal the effects of her exertions. &mdash; &mdash; The torrent
of sound that she now poured forth, the height to which she soared,
the rapidity with which she traversed intervals that connected the
widest extremes of human voice, the precision with which she marked
their minutest subdivisions, and, above all, the ease of attitude
and expression which she preserved amid her exertions, like a skilful
charioteer, who commands and enjoys the flight of his coursers,
whilst their speed terrifies the spectators, filled the Italians with
a sensation which applause could neither express nor exhaust.</p>
</div>

<p>There is, it will be observed, no stint of powerful attributes,
the marvels of Armida leading directly back to Lady
Montrevor in <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i>. Yet the descriptions
here <i>are</i> somewhat softened, and the style is free from the
extravagances of Maturin’s second book; Armida, somehow,
seems more fit for a heroine of this extraordinary kind.
Her cousin Wandesford, though a cold and selfish character,
is so enraptured by her performance that he declares himself
on the spot. Armida decidedly rejects his attentions,
and on the following morning when he calls on her again,
he is informed that Lord Montclare and his daughter have
departed from Italy without any intentions of ever returning.</p>

<p>The second prologue represents Armida in London
society, of which Maturin draws an amusing and curious
picture. Here she is incapable of creating any sensation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But what was the astonishment, the horror, of the beautiful,
intelligent, and ambitious foreigner, on her first introduction to
fashionable life in London: lost amid a crowd where beauty could
not be distinguished; stunned by a buz of nothings, where mind
could not be displayed; elbowed by rouged, naked, dashing dowagers;
suffered to stand unnoticed or eyed through a glass by yawning,
lounging bucks of ton; sinking amid the crowd, to be permitted
to help herself to refreshments, or to want them; to be without
conversation, though a mistress of half the dead and living languages,
from her ignorance of fashionable jargon; to walk down a set
with a partner who appeared to be debating whether it would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
be high ton to drop asleep during the exercise&mdash;what a reception
for a woman who had seen at her feet Italy and France contending
to scatter the laurels of fame and the roses of pleasure.</p>
</div>

<p>Wandesford reappears, and Armida, in her desolation,
receives his attentions with something akin to gratitude.
He renews his proposal, which is eagerly embraced by Lord
Montclare. Harassed on all sides Armida at last complies
and gives Wandesford her word; upon this she is hurried
off to Ireland, where Wandesford is shortly to follow them.&mdash;</p>

<p>These two chapters are a clever preliminary to the thrilling
adventures Armida is going forth to meet, besides
giving a good idea of her character and circumstances. In
spite of her brilliant position in society she feels lonely and
unhappy in her restless life, where in everything she is subjected
to the caprices of her father. Her only pleasure is
the gratification of her pride through the admiration she
excites with her talents; but in England her pride also
gets a severe blow. She feels utterly humiliated and is, as
it were, prepared to meet what she will be forced to surrender
to. In a state of dejection she accepts the proposal of
Wandesford, who is less than indifferent to her, nor is her
future brightened by her father’s determination to set out
for Ireland, which determination she cannot imagine to
be anything but a fit of his incurable melancholy. She
shudders to think of the country she is taken to, and travels
on almost in apathy. Much ‘fury’&mdash;of which there
is quite enough already&mdash;is spared by her not entering
the scene of action immediately from the highest pinnacles
of glory and triumph; and the deeper and truer side of her
character is naturally developed in sorrow and desolation,
which her father’s death increases to the uttermost. Her
new-found relations cannot compensate for the loss. Lady
Montclare, though always wearing a mask of unvarying
suavity, inspires not the least confidence in her daughter,
and her young son, Endymion, is so closely watched by
her and Morosini, that it is impossible for Armida to approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
him. Thus she is inevitably drawn to Connal O’Morven,
who comes like an incarnation of his wild country,
grand and solitary, distinct from anything she has ever
seen or dreamt of, while at the same time the boundless
devotion he offers her recalls by-gone, brighter days to her
mind. Being thus mentally prepared for their fate, they
are thrown together by external events with rather unnecessary
violence: in the first dawn of their acquaintance
Connal finds an opportunity of saving Armida’s life&mdash;at
the risk of his own&mdash;three different times. Upon her
first arrival to the castle her horses are terrified and rear
staggering backwards on to the rock, and she would be
lost did not Connal rush to the scene of imminent danger
and snatch her from the carriage. The following day she
walks out to the shore and sits down on a rock. Lost in
meditations she fails to observe the tide coming on before
it has cut off her return; again she would perish but for
Connal, who happens to be close at hand. And a few days
later, when Wandesford, too, has arrived, he and Armida
and Connal visit a small islet to look at some Celtic antiquities.
In the meantime a dreadful storm breaks out,
and only by exerting his superhuman strength to the utmost
Connal succeeds in rowing them back sufficiently near the
shore to be rescued when the boat capsizes. In all this,
however, there is a kind of inner veracity which saves
any of the passages from becoming merely melodramatic.
The delineation especially of Armida, who is not (like Connal)
raised above human weaknesses, is skilfully represented, and
the descriptions of her mental struggles are both psychologically,
as well as poetically, true. In Ireland everything
is so different from what she is accustomed to, and her
relation particularly to Connal is so uncomfortable, that
all her experience of the great world is unable to guide
her upon her first encounters with him. When Connal
rescues her from the waves of the tide, Armida, in her confusion,
offers him her purse. The manner in which this ill-chosen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
retribution is rejected she imagines to imply contempt
of her person. This is a possibility that has never
before entered her mind; and though it makes her shed
tears of resentment, she is unable to answer with the same
feeling by dismissing him from her recollection; in order
to rid herself from thoughts of Connal, she sits down to&mdash;write
to Wandesford.</p>

<p>Wandesford himself arrives before he is expected, and
is received by Lady Montclare with joyful attention, but
with very marked indifference by Armida. She has contracted
the habit of frequently strolling on the shore,
attended by a newly-acquired friend, Rosine St. Austin.
Here she meets Connal, and their acquaintance is quickly
developed. He sings Irish songs to her and is, on the
whole, quite at his ease, taking no pains to conceal his admiration
for her, as he fully comprehends from first that his
love is hopeless. But Armida, too, is in love, though her
feeling, to begin with, asserts itself as a desire to dazzle him
by the display of her accomplishments, for which purpose
she invites him to the castle; or as what she imagines to
be hatred, when he refuses, being disinclined to enter, as
a stranger, the abode of his forefathers. He comes, however,
and appears to be the only person capable of understanding
Armida and appreciating her talents according
to their merits. Their intimacy grows stronger every moment.
Then follows the excursion to the islet, to which
much piquancy is added by the presence of Wandesford,
who is well aware that he has acquired a formidable rival;
the storm under which Connal is exerting his strength
to save Armida and at the same time his enemy, is very
dramatically depicted. Being at last beyond all danger,
Connal, wildly happy to have Armida in his arms and pressed
to his heart, insists on carrying her so all the way to the
castle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Her wet hair had fallen back from her cheek: he touched it
with his lips: she sighed: his hyacinth breath, warm with life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
passion, passing over her cheek was balmy to her returning senses:
she seemed to see him in a dream. Her arm that hung on his shoulder
now half-extended itself, and sunk again; the soft fingers, with
a tremulous motion, touched his neck: he felt every nerve in his
body shiver: the anguish of passion increased with its hopeless
fondness: he held her to his breast in sweet and bitter ecstacy; he
felt her too precious to be possessed, or to be resigned; he felt that
he could clasp her to his heart with desperate love, and then spring
with her from the rock he was climbing.</p>
</div>

<p>Half-conscious as she is, the attitude touches a latent
chord in Armida’s bosom, which makes her understand her
own feelings; that same night her passion becomes clear
to her. Yet there is still another experience in store for
her, as novel as it is startling: the suspicion of a rival.
The next time she goes to the shore, Connal appears in the
door of a solitary hut which he, with some embarrassment,
confesses that he often visits. Approaching it, Armida
sees through the open door a beautiful woman with an infant
in her lap. After this episode all the pangs of jealousy
are roused to life, and sometimes take a very frenetic mode
of expression. An explanation, however, is soon given by
the woman herself, who accosts Armida and Rosine on one
of their walks and tells them the story of her life. The father
of her child is Wandesford, by whom she has been seduced
during one of his former stays in Ireland, whereupon he
has taken her with him to England and there abandoned
her; under much suffering she has returned to Ireland,
and would have perished but for the assistance of Connal,
who is the only one that has taken pity on her fate. She
is, and has always been, desperately in love with Connal,
but as she understands that he adores Armida, she wishes
to clear his character before her. Armida is calmed, and
when she next meets Connal she is triumphant and impossible
to resist. He is forced to throw himself at her feet, but
remembers the conspiracy he is engaged in, and darkly
hints that they must part for ever.&mdash;</p>

<p>The progress of Armida’s mind to the point of an all-absorbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
passion is described with a consistency and a
flexibility that gives the first remarkable proof of Maturin’s
deep insight into feminine psychology. The characterization
of Connal is much more <i>schablonenmässig</i>: he simply
possesses every mental and bodily perfection. Nevertheless
there are some good observations upon his character, which
tend to naturalness rather than to eulogy. His inexperience
of life and society, an effect of his solitary existence in which
he has thought more than he has seen, is distinctly presented.
Thus his high-sounding theories are sometimes dispersed
by Armida’s charms and his own feelings. Once she
asks him to come to a fête given by a lady in the neighbourhood.
He first refuses to visit a house where, he says,
his grandfather has been insulted; and when Armida resents
his disobedience he assures her that ‘to a Milesian the sacrifice
of his life is trivial to the sacrifice of his pride.’ All
the same he makes his appearance at the feast, the description
of which is one of the finest things in the book.
Armida has been, all the evening, in a state of weariness and
absent-mindedness that greatly enrages Wandesford. Through
his carelessness a part of her drapery is torn in a dance,
and she retires to repair it in the room of Lady Gabriella,
the granddaughter of their hostess. Here she is joined
by Connal, who has been wandering round the gardens in
hope of catching a glimpse of her. Hitherto they have met
mostly under circumstances endangering their lives, or else
amid wildness and desolation; but now they are brought
together in surroundings inviting them to happiness and
joy. Armida confesses to Connal that his feelings are reciprocated,
and they succeed in becoming oblivious to all but
the present moment. Their interview being interrupted she
asks him to accompany her, and he instantly obeys:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But what a different figure entered the ball-room from that
which had quitted it&mdash;glowing, brilliant, her features sparkling
with the tremulous, with the gem-like lustre of hope and passion;
her form almost too bright and light for any element but air to support
or to convey; her very vestments seemed to undergo a change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
like the Cameleon from the air she respired; and her whole figure
realized the fable of the statue converted into woman by the charm
of love. No longer shrinking into obscurity, she accepted the trembling
hand that Connal offered, and when they joined the set, they
scarce seemed beings of the same species with those who surrounded
them.</p>

<p>When the dance began, all the other performers paused almost
involuntarily. Envy was stifled by resistless admiration, and even
applause by wonder. The perfection of their figures, the ease, lightness,
and enjouement of their movements, the exquisite modulation
of their attitudes, that seemed to form a kind of visible music, gave
to the spectators the idea of two descended genii mixing in the festivity.
The light movements of Connal scarce disturbed a ringlet
of the glossy hair that fell on his white neck: and as Armida’s
nymph-like form glided among the dancers, it appeared like a star
sometimes passing through the clouds, sometimes sparkling as it
emerged from them: all gazed with delight, but the anxious Rosine
(who could as little account for Connal’s appearance as for Armida’s
sudden re-animation) and the disappointed Gabriella.</p>

<p>The pressure of company towards the door announced the approach
of supper, and Connal, ignorant of the modern custom of the
young, hurrying down to secure the best accommodations, waited
with the reverence of other days, till every female had quitted the
apartment. The supper-room was completely filled when he entered,
but Lady Gabriella eagerly displacing those near her, offered him
a seat next herself, but Connal slightly bowing, placed himself at
the back of Armida’s chair, and intoxicated with his situation, forgot
alike the luxuries of the feast and the gaze of strangers.</p>

<p>Never had they appeared to each other so resistless: that rose-coloured
light which a brilliant entertainment diffuses on every
object was more congenial to the voluptuous splendour of Armida’s
beauty than the gloom of rocks, or the paleness of moonlight: and
Armida, who amidst all her passion revolted from the chill and stern
character of Connal, his apathy of life, and his contempt of luxury,
now amid scenes that renewed her former existence saw him all
she wished, and like the sun-flower expanded in his unclouded rays.</p>
</div>

<p>This, indeed, is the only time the sun shines upon them.
The fête does not pass off without ominous collisions between
Connal and Wandesford, and Lady Montclare, anxious for
many reasons, hastens to take leave of the party. Having
arrived home Armida again goes to meet Connal on the
rocks. He dare not speak of the conspiration, but gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
her to understand that he is compelled to leave Ireland to
seek his sustenance. Armida, with tears, implores him to
take her with him. All her pride is vanished; henceforth
she is only a woman who loves. A hope springs to life in
Connal, but this night the fatal event takes place which
frustrates all his chances&mdash;it is told by Connal to Armida
long afterwards, but may, for the sake of elucidation, be
mentioned now. Inspired by Armida’s love Connal determines
to dissolve the conspiracy. He seeks out his men,
who are assembled in a cave, adjures them to surrender
themselves to the mercy of the government and make him
their hostage, if need be. They listen with conviction, when
Wandesford, who has traced Connal’s footsteps from the
castle, suddenly appears in their midst. The men are on
the point of killing him, but Connal saves his life and appeals
to him to intercede for them with the government, which
Wandesford promises on his word of honour to do.&mdash;When
Armida, however, on the following morning solemnly rejects
him&mdash;on account of the story of the woman in the hut&mdash;Wandesford
breaks his word without a scruple. He disappears
for some days to prepare for his plan. This interval
is filled by a very romantic description of an old Irish harper,
who has remained faithful to the house of O’Morven. Connal
takes Armida to see him, but he terrifies them both
with prophecies of death and woe. And the following night,
when they are together on the heath, the tower where Connal
lives with his grandfather, is suddenly seen bursting
into flames and besieged by soldiers, who are sent to suppress
the intended rebellion. From this moment Connal is forced
to appear in the character of a leader of rebels. He succeeds
in retiring with his band into an inaccessible place in the
mountains, whence reports of his miraculous valour soon
reach Castle Montclare. Armida, having never taken any
interest in Irish politics, has great difficulty in grasping
what has happened. All the same she would be ready to
follow Connal under any circumstances, but one day the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
news is spread that he has enticed Lady Gabriella to accompany
him into his retreat. In reality this warm-blooded
young lady, who has taken a fancy to the interesting Milesian,
has followed him of her own accord, and Connal immediately
restores her to her grandmother. Armida, however,
finds no reason to doubt the news, and thus once more
becomes a prey to unfounded suspicions. Besides being
repetition, this means of bringing the plot forward is not
very brilliant; but the emotions of Armida are again admirably
analyzed. This time there is no outburst of pride or
indignation, only silent despair. She walks out on the darkening
heath, followed by Rosine, and hurries onward
without aim or purpose, until they sink down exhausted
and presently recognize, without being seen, two figures
passing by them: Connal, conducting Gabriella back to
her home. Having now lost all interest in life, Armida
re-engages herself to Wandesford. His treatment of her
continues to be very unchivalrous, as she does not conceal
that her heart cannot be his; it is, however, determined
that they are to proceed to England directly and get married
there, Armida still being attended by Rosine. Their journey
is soon impeded by a snowstorm, and they fall into the
hands of the rebels. Wandesford is dragged away, but
Connal, who is under the impression that Armida is already
married to him, once more saves his life, enabling him to
proceed alone to the nearest town. Connal then undertakes
to conduct Armida back to Castle Montclare; before long he
understands that she is not the wife of Wandesford, and she,
on her part, learns the truth about Gabriella. After scenes
of great passion their final resolution is impressively told in a
few words, sounding, as it were, like the bang of a heavy gate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The distracted Connal, kneeling before her, implored for a word,
a look of life. “I can no longer see you,” said Armida, sinking from
his arms to the ground; “and though I stretch out my hands, they
wander about, without being able to reach you.”</p>

<p>“God! this is too much for man. Armida! answer!&mdash;Will
you be mine? I speak in despair; I have nothing to offer or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
promise: will you be the companion of a rebel, in a desert, amid
war, and want, and danger?”</p>

<p>Armida, with an impulse like fate, threw herself into his arms.
He clasped her to his heart. &mdash; &mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>There follows now a pause in the narrative, as Connal
tells Armida the story of his life, his engagement in the
rebellion, and the treachery of Wandesford. Upon this
they are obliged to set out for the coast of the Atlantic,
and at this period even Rosine is compelled to leave them.
After a march through a country devastated by the ravages
of famine and rape, enduring intolerable hardships and continual
attacks from the troops of the government, they
finally reach the isles, where a solitary hut with a bed of
rushes becomes the dwelling of Armida for a long time to
come. Ireland has taken her revenge; the proud and
brilliant being at whose feet Europe has lain prostrate, is
changed into a silent and self-sacrificing woman, deprived
of all qualifications ever to re-assume her place in society.
This trait is a remarkable one in the romantic fiction of
the time, where the freshness and buoyancy of a heroine
are usually not in the least affected by perilous adventures
and privations ever so hard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The story of Desmond and Endymion is more eccentric
and presents a curious mixture of passion and fantastic
gracefulness. It has already been said that Endymion, in
reality, is a girl, though her mother, who covets the estates
of Montclare, endeavours to conceal her sex. From the
moment Desmond has clasped her to his heart, in saving
her life, Endymion is absorbed by a feeling for him, the
nature of which she does not comprehend. She plainly
avows her love to Desmond, whom she imagines herself to
regard in the light of an elder brother; he fully shares her
sentiments, but, dreading their apparently unnatural tendency,
tries, though without success, to avoid her presence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; “Oh that sensation,” cried Endymion, “how often
I feel it in your presence: at some moments, at the present, it almost
deprives me of breath, of sense: it is a delight that makes me sick
and giddy: the Italians before an earthquake, have a sensation
for which there is no name; such is the sensation I feel in your presence,
that I could throw myself into your arms and weep, if you
would let me.”</p>

<p>“Stop, stop,” said Desmond, “talk this language no more: if
the sight of each other be thus intoxicating, thus ruinous, let us
part, and see each other no more.”</p>

<p>Endymion wept.</p>

<p>“Oh torture me no more with this fantastic fondness,” said
Desmond, “so unlike what we ought to feel for each other: this
female fastidiousness I cannot bear. I wish to love you like a younger
brother; you treat me with the caprice of a mistress. Endymion,
I cannot endure this. Never did I feel before these wild, these
maddening sensations. I know not what you have done with me;
what strange influence you have obtained over me, but it is an
influence that I must fly from to preserve my reason, my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh! do not, do not talk of going,” said Endymion, ringing
his hands in agony. “Am I so lost that I cannot love or be loved
without being guilty: is my affection a crime, or a curse&mdash;why
must I not love you? It is so sad, none can envy me; none shall
ever see me.” She whispered, “If you will sometimes let me twine
those bright ringlets on my fingers, or gaze on you, when your eye
is averted from me, or touch your hand when it is unconsciously
suspended near me&mdash;and is that too much; can you refuse me
that?”</p>

<p>“I can refuse you nothing, and therefore I must fly from you.
I tried, but I cannot love you as a man: I know what it is to love
a brother well; for Connal I would die, but for you, Endymion,
I would live: live, in you, for you, in your sight: dream life away
in voluptuous and frantic melancholy: the feelings that oppress,
that soften, that sicken me, even now while I speak to you I cannot
describe them; I must not feel them; no, not another moment.
Oh! untwine those arms from me; you are making me wild; my
blood burns like fire in my veins: do not believe these hot tears
that drop on your hands: they are tears of hatred,&mdash;hatred of
myself and you” &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The appearance, in the literature of all times, of a young
female in male attire is, as a rule, connected with the gay
and humorous&mdash;it is enough to call to mind Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
comedies&mdash;or else it is used as a pretty and sentimental
expedient finally leading to a happy result, as in <i>Cymbeline</i>,
in certain episodes in <i>Don Quixote</i>, in the <i>Monastery</i> of
Scott and the <i>Albigenses</i> of Maturin. The figure is not often
taken very seriously, and the disguise still more seldom
leads to conflicts of a tragical import. Of famous literary
characters of the last-mentioned description, Goethe’s Mignon
is slightly recalled by Endymion,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> while the peculiar
circumstances appertaining to the concealment of Endymion’s
sex render her case well-nigh exceptional in fiction.
The topic is delicate enough and its treatment difficult to
the extreme. The tone might easily get a tinge of the
ridiculous, or even of the coarse, yet here it does neither;
Maturin’s singular skill and delicacy in depicting those
young, pale and ethereal beings that unite precocity and
purity, timidity and passion, by no means denies itself in
the creation of Endymion.&mdash;Desmond, as a character,
is more successful than Connal, if only as being less faultless.
He is brave and high-minded like his brother, but at the
same time light-headed and choleric; he is said to have
been ‘famous for rural gallantry,’ and is not insensible to
refined gallantry either. Shortly before the disastrous events
narrated above take place, he learns the fact of Endymion’s
being a woman from the old harper, who has overheard
a conversation between Lady Montclare and the monk
Morosini. About the same time he receives a note inviting
him to a nightly <i>rendez-vous</i>. He takes it to come from
Endymion, and, in spite of the serious admonitions of Connal,
whom he makes his confidant, he goes to the meeting-place;
but to his astonishment he finds that the writer of
the billet is not Endymion, but her mother. Shocked and
disgusted he leaves the castle, being thus absent when the
rebellion breaks out. In the meantime he is thrown into
the arms of Lady Gabriella. Having been rejected by Connal,
she seeks consolation with the younger brother; Desmond,
passionate and disappointed as he is, surrenders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
himself to her charms, and they disappear together for
a long time.&mdash;In the meanwhile Connal leaves his island
and undertakes an adventurous journey to Dublin, having
heard that an eminent person there would be willing to
intercede for him with the government. By accident he
enters a theatre, where he sees his brother with Gabriella,
and from a conversation near him he gathers that their
life is considered to be a perfect scandal. He seeks out
Desmond and persuades him to re-join his regiment, which
is in the vicinity of Castle Montclare. The brothers part,
Desmond being still entirely ignorant of Connal’s participation
in the rebellion. Desmond travels back to the castle,
where his position becomes very painful. Lady Montclare
is about to contract a marriage with his father the agent,
who is wholly unlike his sons. As for Endymion, she continues
to be a victim of the shameful imposture and is, moreover,
surrounded by dangers threatening both her life and
her reason. Her love for Desmond is more conspicuous
than ever; one night he finds her in the chapel where she
is doing penance which Morosini has imposed on her for
permitting her thoughts to dwell too much on Desmond.
As the monk is often present during these penances, and
she confesses that he talks to her in a way she does not
understand, Desmond concludes that his motives for staying
alone with the slightly-clad girl are not purely ecclesiastic.
Indignant and despairing, but at a loss how to treat her,
Desmond withdraws from the scene. The decisive moment,
however, comes that very night; as in the case of Armida
and Connal, it is told in a few simple sentences. Desmond
is roused from his slumbers by hearing Endymion sobbing
at his door and imploring him to open it. At last he yields
to the entreaties:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Desmond!” she cried, starting at his altered looks, though she
could not understand their expression, “Desmond! the wildness
of your eyes terrifies me: I feel there is danger, though I cannot
comprehend it. How your hand burns! how you tremble! Are
you afraid?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“I am, I am,” said the panting Desmond.</p>

<p>“And what is it we fear? I have seen you sit beside your brother;
I have seen you lean on his arm; I have seen your hand locked in his.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you have, and would it were locked in his now,
instead of yours.”</p>

<p>“And why can you not caress me like a brother?”</p>

<p>“Because a woman cannot be my brother,” said Desmond, distractedly.</p>

<p>At these words Endymion started from his arms, and with
a scream of horror flew towards her own apartment; and Desmond,
terrified at the consequences of his own imprudence, pursuing her,
kneeled at her door, and supplicated in his turn for admission in vain.</p>
</div>

<p>Endymion’s horror does not arise from any immediate
realization of what she has heard; though she has attained
a standpoint at which a continuation of the imposture
would destroy her reason, the vital truth regarding herself
becomes clear to her but by degrees. But she recollects
having heard her mother say to Morosini: ‘should she ever
learn she is a woman, she must live no longer,’ and this
she at once applies to herself. The next day she rushes
to Desmond and wildly implores him to save her, as she
is to be sent away under the protection of the monk. Desmond
fortunately remembers a clergyman called St. Austin,
uncle to Armida’s friend Rosine, to whom they succeed in flying.
He unites them and procures for them a solitary retreat,
where they spend some idyllic months in perfect felicity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On arriving at Dublin Connal learns that the eminent
person in whom he has placed his hope is in Ireland no
more. The only thing for him to do, under the circumstances,
is to return to the island, where his presence indeed
would be urgently necessary. He has confided Armida to
the protection of a young man of the name of Brennan,
who secretly hates him and, what is worse, cherishes a violent
passion for Armida. He begins to harass her with his
attentions, and they being met in a way that may be surmised,
extends his hatred towards her as well, devising an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
exquisite mode of vengeance. He comes one night to the
hut where Armida lives attended by a peasant woman,
and requires her to accompany him, on the pretext that
O’Morven has returned and wishes to see her. He then
conducts her into a cavern where there really is an O’Morven:
the old grandfather of Connal, who is now totally
insane and appears to bear a particular malevolence against
Armida. It is Brennan’s intention to have her murdered
by the maniac, which undoubtedly would happen, did not
Connal arrive at the very last moment. His journey thither
has been much retarded by his being wounded by three
men whom Brennan has sent out to waylay and assault
him. Now, after a hideous fight, Brennan’s own life is ended.
Yet Connal is wanted for more than one reason. The state
of his band has, in his absence, grown utterly desperate;
it is again seen how soberly and realistically Maturin conceived
the business of the rebellion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The discipline that Connal had established was destroyed:
instead of confining themselves to the islands, they had spread
themselves along the shore, exercising every outrage and aggression
on the inhabitants; and, from the indiscriminate admission of
every vagabond and profligate into the ranks, their numbers had
increased beyond all power of control, and the spirit of humanity
and honour, that Connal had tried to inspire them with, was utterly
extinguished.</p>
</div>

<p>In proportion as this barbarization increases, the chances
of any reconciliation with the government naturally diminish,
and the final traces of Connal’s own enthusiasm for
the cause disappear as well. Troops are now everywhere
collected to march against him, and besides being daily
beset by enemies, Connal is besieged by a terrible anxiety
for the fate of Armida. One day a detachment of soldiers
come over to the island. The officer at their head is wounded,
and it is only with difficulty that Connal saves him
from being killed by the rebels. He is taken care of, and
to his horror Connal recognizes Desmond, who, to this
moment, has been ignorant of the story of Armida and Connal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
His own paradisiacal existence with Endymion&mdash;or
Ines, as she is now called&mdash;has come to a sorrowful end.
They have been traced to their retreat, and one night the
door is burst open whereupon Morosini rushes in with two
attendants. The monk pursues Ines as she flees out of the
hut, while the attendants attempt to detain Desmond. He
overpowers them, however, and follows in pursuit of his
wife, whom he sees plunge herself into the river with the
monk in hot haste after her. Some days later the body of
Morosini is found, but no traces of Ines. Desmond, being
now possessed of the sole desire to court death, joins his
regiment, and Wandesford immediately takes care to command
him to march against Connal.</p>

<p>Though disapproving of the rebellion, Desmond resolves
to fight and perish with Connal. Before the decisive battle
he conducts Armida away and places her at the house of
St. Austin, where Rosine still resides, and then returns to
the island. The battle is fought, and, contrary to all expectation,
both Connal and Desmond survive it. The former
finds his way to a remote and solitary cave, where he
hides himself with his dying grandfather. Desmond, weak
and wounded, goes back to the castle. He is carefully nursed
by Lady Montclare, whose husband has recently died and
who now conceives a plan concerning Desmond. Her whole
life has been a struggle to keep in her family the estates
of Montclare, and her last resort turns out to be a marriage
between Armida and Desmond. To that end she has her
daughter brought to the castle and imposes on her the
fraudulent statement that Connal is in the hands of Wandesford,
and is to suffer death unless she consents to marry
Desmond. Of Armida there is, by this time, left but a faded
beauty and a ruined mind; but seeing that she is only
required to persevere in her self-sacrifice for Connal, she
easily consents. Nor does Desmond oppose himself; both
are too weary and apathetic even to enquire for the reasons
of Wandesford’s singular resolution. The report of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
intended marriage reaches Connal. He meets Lady Montclare
who, in fear of her life, solemnly declares that it is
Armida’s will and that he is to hear it from her own lips.
She arranges an interview between them, and Armida has
strength enough to stand to her resolution, the reasons for
which she promises to disclose to Connal immediately after
her wedding. The night of this very interview, however,
Connal is plunged into despair at seeing how innocent
people are punished for having given him shelter, and thus
he straightway betakes himself to Wandesford to deliver
himself up. Still he is not to die yet; Wandesford, to
whom the whole affair is one of personal hatred and vengeance,
orders five hundred lashes to be administered to
him, whereupon he is to be set free, in case he survives the
scourging. He does survive it, and is able to keep his last
appointment with Armida. The night of Armida’s wedding
Connal is wandering near the castle, when Wandesford rides
past him. Connal challenges him and shoots him through
the heart, and he expires repenting his crimes.&mdash;In the
meantime Armida, having fulfilled what she imagines her
last duty towards Connal, takes her fate in her own hands.
Her late father has been an expert in, and also initiated
his daughter into, the interesting science of preparing poisons.
Immediately before the ceremony is to commence
she swallows a dose of poison that has the power of dismissing
life, without pain, in eight and forty hours. The marriage,
however, is destined never to be contracted; just as
the priest is opening his book, a piercing shriek rings through
the chapel, and Ines appears in their midst. She has been
saved from the river by the agents of Lady Montclare, and,
since then, been secretly imprisoned in the castle. Her
reason is irrevocably lost: she does not even recognize Desmond.
Sick of horrors Armida retires to her apartment,
whither Rosine brings Connal at the appointed hour. Everything
is now explained; the conversation is interrupted
only by a party of soldiers breaking into the castle, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
quest of Connal. He is conducted to take his trial for
rebellion, by martial law, and the sentence is death. At
the moment the soldiers fire, Desmond rushes to Connal
and falls with him. Armida and Ines likewise find their
death beside the corpses of their respective lovers. Rosine
and her uncle are left to inter the dead; Lady Montclare,
it is stated, buries her crimes and her remorse in
a convent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The end, it is clear, somewhat lowers the level of the
book and disturbs the final effect. From the rather unnatural
idea of marriage between Armida and Desmond and
onwards in the ensuing events there is much that is strained
and stilted in the story; the circumstance of Armida’s
extraordinary poison is too trivial and absurd to make any
serious impression. The closing scene is entirely melodramatic:
the eight and forty hours come to an end exactly
at the time of Connal’s execution, and Ines expires at the
same moment for the simple reason that everybody else
does. But, strange to say, the chief incident itself, causing
this conventional winding up of a highly romantic story,
strikes one with its painful realism. One of the most remarkable
features in <i>The Milesian Chief</i> is the mode of Connal’s
death. In romances with tragical issue, of the time, the
hero may die in a battle, he may die by accident, he may
commit suicide or even be assassinated; but to let him
first be flogged and then executed in consequence of the
sentence of a court martial, is to excite terror and pity
at the expence of the atmosphere of greatness and invincible
superiority with which he is surrounded in the beginning
of the tale. To reject everything conciliatory in the
tragic, to bereave the death of a hero of every trait of
sublimity and poetical splendour, to let his own person, as
it were, be degraded by the ignominy he is exposed to,
is certainly alien to the spirit and methods of the early
19:th century romanticism. The manner in which Scott<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
allows the Master of Ravenswood to end his days is perfectly
characteristic of the period, while the death of Connal
O’Morven anticipates ideas much more modern. There
is, in the end of Connal, something that brings to mind
a very impressive Irish story of later date, the <i>Maelcho</i> (1894)
of Emily Lawless, treating of the Desmond wars (1579-81),
where the romantic halo in which the hero is enveloped is
torn into shreds by degrees, until he is, both mentally and
physically broken, hanged obscurely, <i>en passant</i>, like any
of the countless victims of those troubled times.&mdash;</p>

<p>Of the principal personages in <i>The Milesian Chief</i> Armida
and Ines are the most remarkable as types of some
novelty in the fiction of the time. The latter is not without
parallels in Maturin’s own work, but her originality lies
in the absence of all reflection or principle: she acts solely
by instinct, never expending a thought upon the moral
standard of her feelings, and guided only by the nature
contrary to whose intentions she has been reared up. A
young lady answering to the description of Armida is uncommon
in all romantic literature. The Radcliffe heroine, as
has been pointed out by a critic,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> is but a slight variation
of the one favoured by Richardson: weak and sentimental,
only calculated to move pity, never doing anything for
her lover, who gladly sacrifices his life for her. As for the
heroines of Scott, many of them, no doubt, display activity
and courage and accomplish wonders for others, yet none
would, in all likelihood, take the step Armida does, were
they in her position; none have the independence of mind
and superiority of intellect which render her perfectly regardless
of the opinion of the world. The pride and the accomplishments,
the <i>grandezza</i> and the accustomedness to obedience
and admiration with which she is invested, usually
distinguish females of a maturer age, like Lady Ashton in
<i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> and Lady Montrevor in <i>The Wild
Irish Boy</i>. But though Armida entirely lacks that girlish
docility and inexperience which seems to require manly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
protection, Maturin has succeeded in making her young
and natural, and it is described with great beauty and power
how her stateliness melts away before an overwhelming
passion, and how the burning heart of youth demands its
due when opportunity arises.</p>

<p>The characterization of Connal and Desmond, as has
already been pointed out, is not equal to that of Armida
and Ines. The best-drawn male character in the book is
Wandesford, who is surprisingly real. He is a man of the
world of the selfish and unfeeling kind, retaining some
outward dignity by displaying a sort of conventional courage,
that, ‘stimulated by witnesses, or by military tumult, could
rush on death: the courage of the senses rather than the
mind.’ When the latter is required, as on the occasion of
his being well-nigh drowned with Armida and Connal, he
proves to be a coward at heart. He is incapable of generosity
towards his enemy, and his bad qualities always grow
worse when met by adversities; thus in his strife with
Connal, whom he hates as a rival and dislikes as an Irishman,
he continually sinks deeper into the quagmire of crime
and dishonour, which process is quite plausible and recounted
without exaggeration. The narrow, unimaginative side
of his character is well illustrated by his discussion, especially
with Armida, whose superiority he cannot avoid instinctively
to feel:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The hearts of your whole sex,” said Wandesford, furiously,
“are not worth the earth I tread: you have no heart: you have
nothing but pride, caprice, and desire. While the first men in Europe
were at your feet, you spurned them. My honourable addresses,
the addresses of a man of the first family, fortune, and character
were despised; but the moment you saw this Irishman, this heir
of the poverty, and pride, and infamy of his country, you rushed
into his arms, though he dashed you from them. Perhaps his figure
awoke your classical taste, and you wished to transfer your study,
like the statuary of old, from marble to flesh.”&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>In the case of certain other personages Maturin’s sovereign
contempt for a secondary character comes to light.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
This is, indeed, one of the most conspicuous flaws of the
book. All delineation, for instance, of the wonderful mind
of Lady Montclare is omitted. She is perfectly stereotyped;
it is only evident that her every thought runs upon keeping
the estates of her husband, and that she is, to this end,
ready to commit the most atrocious crimes with an ever-smiling
countenance&mdash;but in the reality of her being it
is impossible to believe. Another character of whom much
might have been made is the elder O’Morven, Connal’s
father, who has gratefully accepted the situation of land-steward
to Lord Montclare. He might be all the more
interesting as he is expressly said to represent the worst
kind of Irish character, being intent upon ‘unfeeling, unworthy
self-enjoyment, not destitute of affection, but wholly
without dignity.’ He receives Armida and her father on
their arrival at the castle, and his conversation is expressive
enough:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There he (Connal) has shut himself up in a hovel with that old
fool my father, and all my hopes of him are destroyed; and it was
not from my want of speaking to him either, for says I to him, as
I said, ‘Why, Connal, where’s the use of your refusing his lordship’s
kindness? Where did I get this good coat on my back, and a seat
at his table (for your lordship promised I should not dine with the
servants)? and where did your brother get his commission? Was
it not from his lordship condescending to take us up, and forgetting
our offence in being his relations?’ And says I, Do you think that
poring over an old Irish manuscript, or wandering over these wild
shores, listening to an old harp with hardly a string to it will put
a potatoe in your mouth, or give a stone to repair those ruins you
live in, or bring you back your land to you again?</p>
</div>

<p>Upon this, however, he is all but dropped out of the
plot; he is very seldom brought into contact with his sons,
and, upon the whole, plays no part in the story. Towards
the end it is told that he is married by Lady Montclare, and
shortly afterwards dies, wearied by her ‘violence’&mdash;of
which the reader is not favoured with one single instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p><i>The Milesian Chief</i> could not be better characterized
than Talfourd<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> does in his much-quoted phrase: ‘There is
a bleak and misty grandeur about it which, in spite of its
glaring defects, sustains for it an abiding place in the soul.’
The defects are glaring indeed. The composition, here as
always the blind side of Maturin, is anything but flawless.
The development of the intrigue is sometimes primitive,
sometimes rough and rhapsodical. Repetition occurs frequently
in the adventures&mdash;the saving of lives especially
is an actual habit with the brothers O’Morven; Connal’s
journey to Dublin is so long as to be a digression, and not
particularly interesting; the end is forced and theatrical,
and some of the characters are made nothing of. These
faults were, at all times, counterpoised by plenty of good
characterization and impressive narrative; but now, at a
distance of a hundred years, they appear so unimportant
just because the whole is wrapped up in that ‘bleak and
misty grandeur.’ The absence of technical defects is, after
all, but a negative merit which swiftly loses its charm, while
the creations of a truly poetical imagination are never entirely
defaced by the wear and tear of time. The romantic
atmosphere about the best scenes in <i>The Milesian Chief</i>,
in so far as such a thing can be defined, arises from a close
affinity between the human emotions and the sombre scenery
around, effected by the instrumentality of a suggestive,
passionate, and musical style. In point of description <i>The
Milesian Chief</i> shows a great advance from Maturin’s earlier
works; the nature of Western Ireland had, perhaps, never
yet been depicted with a power and accuracy like this.
Hence it is difficult to embrace the opinion of a critic<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
that in the description of scenery the influence of Mrs. Radcliffe
is discernible. In <i>Montorio</i> it was, and it is easy to
perceive that neither was acquainted with the Mediterranean
nature which they painted in such glowing colours. But here
there is quite a different strain, Northern and familiar; or
what is to be said, for instance, of this sonorous passage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The character of the scene was grandeur&mdash;dark, desolate, and
stormy grandeur. The sea, troubled with rains and winds, dashed
its grey waves along a line of rocky coast with a violence that seemed
even in the absence of a storm to announce perpetual war and
unexhausted winter. The dark clouds, though they moved rapidly
along, never left the horizon clear, and seemed too thick for rains
to melt or storms to disperse. The country near the shore, brown,
stony and mountainous, looked as if the sun never shone on it, as
if it lay for ever under the grey and watery sky: the shore itself,
bold, high, and sweeping, had all the savage precipitateness, the
naked solitude, the embattled rockiness, which nature seems to throw
round her as a fortress, where she retires from the assaults of the
elements, and the approach of man.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been hinted before that <i>The Milesian Chief</i> seems
indebted to Miss Owenson’s <i>Wild Irish Girl</i>. The germ of
the plot may have been taken from the latter: an Irish
family of princely descent have sunk into poverty and lost
their lands to an Englishman whom they regard as an usurper&mdash;the
complications this circumstance leads to form
the incidents in both tales. These, however, are quite differently
developed. Miss Owenson’s story has the character
of an idyll rather than a tragedy, being brought to a happy
and harmonious end. Nor is there any communion between
the principal personages. The venerable figure of the prince
of Inismore Maturin had already borrowed in <i>The Wild
Irish Boy</i>; here, presumably to avoid repetition, the burden
of chieftaincy is placed upon younger shoulders, and
the old Milesian, who is but once brought upon the scene
of action, is represented as a complete ruin. Connal, then,
as an Irishman, is a new type in the fiction of his country.
Reminiscences of the antiquarian enthusiasm of Miss Owenson
crop up in some of the conversations between Armida
and Connal, where particularly the poetry and music of the
ancient Irish is extensively discussed and warmly striven
for.&mdash;The Radcliffe school&mdash;through the medium of <i>Montorio</i>&mdash;is
slightly recalled only by the trio of Lord and
Lady Montclare and Morosini. From Maturin’s first romance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
proceed the figures of the dark, melancholy-looking nobleman
whose conscience is weighed down by an evil deed,
and of the diabolical monk who is his confidant and tormentor
at the same time. Yet Lord Montclare shows a development
from the genuine Gothic Romance, represented by
count Montorio. The latter has committed a bloody and
terrible crime, the remembrance of which confines him
within the walls of a gloomy castle, where he sits brooding
over his deeds and starting at the slightest sound. The
offence which Lord Montclare is guilty of is of a less violent
kind and has the opposite effect of driving him restlessly
from land to land. With him a step is taken towards the
type of the Wanderer.</p>

<p>A great many passages in <i>The Milesian Chief</i> anticipate
the manner of Scott rather than recall Mrs Radcliffe and
Lewis. Very characteristic is the well-written episode where
Brennan conducts Armida to the old O’Morven. The silent
desolation of the night; Brennan’s sudden appearance in
the hut and the alarm of the peasant woman, who in vain
dissuades Armida from following him; his conversation on
the way; the impotent rage of the maniac, and lastly the
furious fight between Connal and Brennan: all this is horrifying,
certainly, but in the same way horrible as are innumerable
scenes in Scott. The difference, in this respect&mdash;apart
from the question of the supernatural&mdash;between
the school of Scott and the school of Radcliffe, is, that the
thrilling, the exciting, is removed from the vaults of a castle
and the dungeons of the Inquisition out into the open air
under a Northern sky. But there is even a more obvious
reason to mention Scott in connection with <i>The Milesian
Chief</i>. Talfourd adds to his phrase quoted above: ‘Yet
never perhaps was there a more unequal production&mdash;alternately
exhibiting the grossest plagiarism and the wildest
originality.’ From where the plagiarism is suggested,
unless from <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i>, the present writer is unable
to say; Maturin’s novel is, on the contrary, alleged to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
been a subject for imitation for no less a man than Walter
Scott himself. The resemblance of <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>
(1819) to <i>The Milesian Chief</i> is, in fact, far more detailed
than that of the latter to the story of Miss Owenson.
Edgar Ravenswood, like Connal O’Morven, is the heir of
a once powerful family whose dominions have passed into
the possession of an Englishman. Like his Milesian counterpart
he lives in an old tower in great poverty, profoundly
discontented with the supposed oppressor. The new owners,
in both cases, have a daughter, and the two heroes of the
respective tales have occasion to begin their acquaintance
with the fair ones by saving their lives. Both fall in love,
and the love of both is reciprocated. Connal becomes the
leader of a rebellion which his love to Armida would induce
him to suppress; Ravenswood, too, is involved in a conspiracy
against the government, from which his attachment to
Lucy Ashton urges him to withdraw. Both love-stories
finally end in a tragic way, the heroines being first, by fraud,
brought to the point of union with another.&mdash;With all
these likenesses, it is of interest to note how differently the
two novelists work up the subject-matter they have in
common. Maturin, as usual, is for the extreme, making the
conditions of his hero desperate from the first, and the
contrast between the two families as striking as possible.
Connal lives in the remote and unknown West of Ireland,
hated and despised by the new lord&mdash;relatives as they are&mdash;and
supported only by a handful of peasants. All paths are
practically closed to him; he is, as it were, predestined to
his fate. In <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>, constructed with
the temperate and easy skill of Scott, no such contrarieties
are felt. Edgar Ravenswood is acknowledged and entertained
by Sir William Ashton, he possesses powerful friends,
and would, no doubt, advance far in the world but for his
fatal love for Lucy. The course of events, here, runs smoother
but is, at the same time, more varied and less easy to
guess beforehand; compared with <i>The Milesian Chief</i>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
book seems to contain almost an infinite variety of characters
and episodes. Ravenswood himself is rather a solitary
figure in Scott, being destitute of the light-heartedness and
sunny good-humour of his youthful heroes in general. Yet
he has his faults, and in comparison with Connal, seems
almost real. But if Scott was more successful with the
male characters, Maturin was more so with the feminine.
There is no denying that Armida is far more interesting
than Lucy. The latter is, in fact, nothing but the weak
and passive type from the preceding century, merely ennobled
by the hand of Scott, and would never be able, like
Armida, to support the central part of a story. That the
emotional element in <i>The Milesian Chief</i> outweighs the
ruggedness of the construction and the poverty of the action
may be ascribed to the skilful characterization of Armida;
and a chapter like the twentieth in <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>
seems quite tame and colourless after the fiery love-scenes
described by Maturin.</p>

<p>To how high a degree the resemblance of the one romance
to the other is a result of direct influence and intentional
imitation, it would be purposeless to discuss. It may even
be quite accidental, for in a country with the history of Scotland
and Ireland, a theme like this must have been both
natural and lent itself profitably to the novelist. That the
outlines were furnished by actual life is made more than
probable by their continued appearance in Irish literature.
They are made use of, as late as 1845, in Charles Lever’s
story of <i>The O’Donoghue</i>. During nine hundred years, the
heads of this family have been kings of that part of Ireland
where their castle stands. Towards the end of the 18:th
century they fall into a state of decay and are compelled to
part with their castle and their estates, which are sold to
a wealthy English baronet who has a beautiful daughter.
The old O’Donoghue, with his two sons, is reduced to the
state almost of peasants. The elder of these sons is, like
Connal O’Morven, a proud and impetuous character, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
a deep sense of his own and his country’s wrongs prompts
to embrace the insurrection of ’98; the younger, a counterpart
of Desmond, turns Protestant and enters Trinity College.
Otherwise the tales of Maturin and Lever contain no elements
in common&mdash;the elder O’Donoghue succeeds in
escaping to France, the younger finally marries the baronet’s
daughter&mdash;and thus imitation is entirely out of the
question. But from an intended preface to <i>The O’Donoghue</i>,
where Lever tells<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> how the story occurred to him while
on a tour in the South of Ireland, it appears how conspicuous
these impoverished descendants of noble families were
in Irish society:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Between the great families&mdash;the old houses of the land and the
present race of proprietors&mdash;there lay a couple of generations of
men who, with all the traditions and many of the pretensions of
birth and fortune, had really become in ideas, modes of life, and
habits, very little above the peasantry about them. They inhabited,
it is true, the “great house,” and they were in name the owners of the
soil, but, crippled by debt and overborne by mortgages, they subsisted
in a shifty conflict with their creditors, rack-renting their
miserable tenants to maintain it. Survivors of everything but
pride of family, they stood there like stumps, blackened and charred,
the last remnants of a burnt forest, their proportions attesting the
noble growth that preceded them.</p>

<p>What would the descendants of these men prove when, destitute
of fortune and helpless, they were thrown upon a world that
actually regarded them as blamable for the unhappy condition of
Ireland? Would they stand by “their order” in so far as to adhere
to the cause of the gentry? Or would they share the feelings of the
peasant to whose lot they had been reduced, and charging on the
Saxons the reverses of their fortune, stand forth as rebels to England?</p>
</div>

<p>Now in the preface to <i>The Milesian Chief</i> Maturin had
promised to apply his powers to scenes of actual life. The
actual life of the class of society he was choosing for his
subject had, according to the sentence of Lever, also a sordid
and prosaic side, nor could they all be regarded as martyrs
for their country without any fault of their own. As
Maturin’s peculiar powers were, above all, in ‘painting life
in extremes,’ he described not so much what is, as what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
would be, under given circumstances, exceptional indeed,
but not impossible; and even in so doing he was, as has
been pointed out, most attracted by the phenomena in the
‘recesses of the human heart.’ Thus the promise of actual
life, in the usual sense of the word, is but imperfectly
fulfilled. Yet beneath the delineations of human passions
of general applicability, there is, however, a perceptible
glimpse of a certain aspect of unmistakable Irish life&mdash;in
the absence of which Mangan<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> would hardly have called
<i>The Milesian Chief</i> the most intensely Irish story he knew of.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of Maturin’s third book, any more than of his second,
no contemporary reviews are extant, but its immediate
success&mdash;at least where the author was known&mdash;seems
to have been considerable. The writer in the <i>New Monthly
Magazine</i> 1827 tells us that the book ‘received encomiums
from many of the leading critics,’ and that ‘several individuals,
inspired perhaps by the highly-wrought and poetical
feeling of “The Milesian,” composed sundry “complimentary
verses” upon it.’ Yet a second edition never appeared, and
that Maturin’s circumstances continued to be distressing,
all biographers agree.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> His delicacy in concealing himself
behind a pseudonym was of no avail to him regarding
his chances of religious preferment; according to the aforesaid
writer these were completely destroyed by the publication
of his novels. So far, however, from abandoning the Muses,
Maturin turned his poetical inspiration in another direction,
still more contradictory to his profession. He became a dramatist,
probably encouraged by the success bestowed upon
a new play of no very remarkable merit. In 1813 Richard
Lalor Sheil, the celebrated Irish barrister, produced a tragedy
called <i>Adelaide, or the Emigrants</i>, written for the highly
talented Miss O’Neill, who, after many hardships in obscure
provincial theatres, had been engaged at the Old Crow-Street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Street Theatre in Dublin. The decided success of Sheil&mdash;who
also had composed his play in order to defray some
necessary expenses&mdash;incited Maturin to follow his example.
He sat down to write a drama in good earnest, as in his
juvenile years he had often done for amusement. Already
in the latter part of the year he was able to send in his
<i>Bertram</i>, but the management of the theatre, for some reason
or other, thought it advisable to reject it. Nearly a year
afterwards Maturin hit upon it among his manuscripts, and,
on the advice of a friend, sent it over for the perusal of his
literary correspondent Walter Scott. The kindness of Scott
was never appealed to in vain; he read the play and warmly
recommended it to John Kemble, as he relates<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> in a letter
to Daniel Terry, dated Nov. 10:th 1814, observing that
<i>Bertram</i> is ‘one of those things which will either succeed
greatly, or be damned gloriously, for its merits are marked,
deep, and striking, and its faults of a nature obnoxious to
ridicule.’ With every allowance for Scott’s desire to help
Maturin, it seems unquestionable that he was really impressed
by the play. After a few critical remarks upon the last
act, he concludes his letter to Terry: ‘With all this, which
I should say had I written the thing myself, it is grand
and powerful: the language most animated and poetical;
and the characters sketched with a masterly enthusiasm.’</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these eulogies Kemble refused the play,
and its fate seemed as doubtful as ever. Fortunately for
Maturin, however, the committee of management of the
Drury Lane Theatre were, in the following year, wanting
something new for their repertory. The members of that
body were, in 1815, men of high literary aspirations; the
procurement of plays devolved on Lord Byron, who states<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
that the number he was supplied with amounted to
five hundred, not one of which he could think of accepting.
His attempts to exact a new play from some of the foremost
writers of the day remained without effect, but Scott, to
whom he also addressed himself, faithfully referred him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Maturin. A correspondence ensued, in consequence of which,
Byron says,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> ‘Maturin sent his <i>Bertram</i> and a letter <i>without</i>
his address, so that at first I could give him no answer.
When I at last hit upon his residence, I sent him a favourable
answer and something more substantial. His play succeeded;
but I was at that time absent from England.’</p>

<p>The answer must indeed have been a favourable one,
for, to judge from a letter from John Murray<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to Scott,
dated Dec. 25:th 1815, <i>Bertram</i> created quite a sensation in
the committee:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was with Lord Byron yesterday. He enquired after you,
and bid me say how much he was indebted to your introduction of
your poor Irish friend Maturin, who had sent him a tragedy, which
Lord Byron received late in the evening, and read through without
being able to stop. He was so delighted with it that he sent it immediately
to his fellow-manager, the Hon. George Lamb, who, late as
it came to him, could not go to bed without finishing it. The result
is that they have laid it before the rest of the Committee; they,
or rather Lord Byron, feels it his duty to the author to offer it himself
to the managers of the Covent Garden. The poor fellow says
in his letter that his hope of subsistence for his family for the next
year rests upon what he can get for this play. I expressed a desire
of doing something, and Lord Byron then confessed that he had
sent him fifty guineas.</p>
</div>

<p>In a letter to Moore, written from Venice in 1817, Byron
again expresses<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> his satisfaction at having been able to
promote the ‘first and well-merited success’ of this ‘very
clever fellow.’ There is no reason to doubt that Byron’s
admiration was genuine. The high opinion he entertained
of <i>Bertram</i> may, of course, have been biassed by his regard
for Scott, like that of Scott by motives of friendship; but
there is that in Maturin’s tragedy which reflects the spirit
of the time with peculiar distinctness; from many of its
wild effusions speaks the very <i>Zeitgeist</i> of romanticism,
which was sure to find response with the best of the age as
well as with the general public.</p>

<p>Before the play could be finally accepted, the approval
of Kean had to be obtained. Kean had spent the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
part of 1815 on a tour extended to Dublin, where he appeared
at the Crow-Street Theatre as Richard II, Othello, and
Hamlet. In the beginning of 1816 the great man returned
to London, and <i>Bertram</i> was submitted to his judgment.
Kean did not share the enthusiasm of the committee; according
to his biographer<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> he pronounced the play to be
‘all sound and fury signifying nothing,’ yet offering a welcome
relief after the characters of Shakespeare. His principal
reason, however, for undertaking to perform the part
of the hero was the conviction that it would ‘serve to increase
his reputation.’ After a few rehearsals he came to realize
that the part of Bertram was but a secondary one; but there
being, as he said, no Mrs. Siddons to eclipse him in the
part of the heroine, he resolved to do his best to eclipse Miss
Somerville. In this he succeeded so well that <i>Bertram</i>,
by all accounts, really did much to increase his reputation
as the leading tragedian of the time.&mdash;</p>

<p>Between the production and first performance of <i>Bertram</i>
there was a lapse of more than two years, during which the
monotony of Maturin’s existence was but seldom broken
by occurrences worthy of notice. An instance of his poetical
carelessness in practical matters is thus related in the <i>Irish
Quarterly Review</i> 1852:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whilst he was composing Bertram, and living amidst a confused
sea of difficulties, a clergyman, high in the church, had called upon
him in York-street for the purpose of making him an offer of preferment;
he was requested to wait for a few minutes, and after the
lapse of half an hour, Maturin entered, his hair in dishevelled masses,
wrapped in a flowing morning gown, and bearing in one hand a pen,
in the other a portion of the manuscript of Bertram, from which
he was repeating some highly wrought sentence just completed;
he threw himself on the sofa beside his starched visitor, who very
soon retreated, leaving the poet to cultivate the muse, in poverty
and at leisure.</p>
</div>

<p>An anecdote like this, whether true or invented, affords,
no doubt, a glimpse of Maturin as he really was, and has
a deeply tragical as well as a comical side. It marks the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
perpetual conflict between what he was inclined to do and
what he, in the opinion of the world, ought to have been doing;
and when the fit of inspiration had subsided, the bitterness
of seeing his family imperfectly provided for was always
there. That Maturin repeatedly received assistance from
liberal friends is seen from the correspondence of Byron,
yet at the same time there are recorded certain actions of
Maturin himself, which display uncommon generosity towards
others, at least in one in his position. He was prevailed
upon to become security for a relation, who subsequently
had recourse to the act of insolvency, leaving Maturin
burthened with a heavy debt for many years to come.
This new disaster possibly caused him again to take up his
rejected drama. The fact of Maturin’s being acceptable
as security for a considerable sum, however, would go to
show that his circumstances were not all times absolutely
desperate&mdash;which also might be inferred from the story
of an alleged literary production of his, connected with the
latter part of 1815. A poetical competition had been
announced by Trinity College in order to celebrate the Battle
of Waterloo. Here, according to the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>
1827, Maturin easily carried off the prize with a poem which
he, ‘in a most handsome manner,’ presented to a pupil of
his called Shea<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and declined all profit from the publication
of it. The poem was printed in January 1816, when
<i>Bertram</i> already had been accepted to Drury Lane and Maturin,
no doubt, was full of sanguine expectations. This
Mr. Shea was a pupil of Maturin’s to whom he appears to
have been greatly attached; one of his letters to Murray,
dated July 6:th 1816, ends with the following plea for him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like all Irishmen, I reserve the most important part of my letter
for the last. Mr. Shea, my pupil, of whom you have heard me talk
so highly and justly while in London, has produced a poem on the
marriage of the princess, I want you to publish it&mdash;I am satisfied
of its merits and the certainty of its success.&mdash;</p>

<p>His friends are numerous and wealthy, and the work would
have a most rapid sale. I am sure you will not decline encouraging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
this young Muse, when I make her introduction through you a matter
of personal and particular obligation to&mdash;Yours most truly C. Rob.
Maturin.</p>
</div>

<p>There is, indeed, no positive proof of Maturin’s being
the author of <i>Lines on the Battle of Waterloo</i>, except the
categorical statement in the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, besides
the circumstance that the name of Shea, despite the wealthy
and numerous friends, was destined never to adorn the
history of English poetry. The poem is, however, furnished
with a few notes written in a half-playful tone, where the
author makes a reservation to eventual accusations of plagiarism,
which notes, on account of the style alone, must
be concluded to flow from the pen of Maturin. Of a passage
like this, a student of Maturin can hardly doubt the authorship:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Poem written by one who owed nothing to communication
with other minds, would be original in every sense of the word&mdash;but
the paucity of its materials would probably ill atone for the
novelty of the structure; it would be perhaps like the Indian love-song
mentioned I think in Ashe’s travels, where all the varieties
of sentiment, and modulations of language, that the passion might
be supposed capable of inspiring, are compressed into three short
sentences, strongly resembling the monotonous chirp of their native
birds&mdash;I love you&mdash;I love you dearly&mdash;I love you all day long.</p>
</div>

<p>The value of the poem itself is very moderate. Though
endowed with a highly poetical temperament, Maturin was
not a poet in the strictest sense of the word. Rhyme was an
instrument of which he never became a master; the writer
in the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> says that he had ‘a natural
distaste to the constant return of sound arising from the
restraints it threw upon his luxuriant fancy.’ He mentions
the <i>Waterloo</i> as a singular example of Maturin’s being able
to overcome his rooted aversion to the labours of versification,
and cites two or three instances where he strove
in vain to conquer the insurmountable difficulties it used
to cause him. In 1821, when Ireland had the doubtful honour
to receive a visit from George IV, Maturin, among many
others, thought the occasion to demand a versified homage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
to the monarch. After the laborious production of three
lines, however, he destroyed the paper ‘in a transport of
rage.’ From <i>Montorio</i>, which abounds with indifferent
poetry, it was already seen which way Maturin’s powers
lay. His poetical prose is always fine and rhythmical in
form, and very often original in ideas, whereas his rhymes
are trivial, and usually make the thoughts so. The poem
on Waterloo treats, in an obscure and bombastical style,
less of the battle itself than of the glory of those who won
it; the opening lines are, perhaps, the most worthy of quotation:</p>

Pope.
</p>


<p>On the 9:th of May 1816 Maturin’s <i>Bertram, or the Castle
of St. Aldobrand</i> had its first performance at Drury Lane
and ran, under general acclamation, for twenty two nights
in succession.</p>

<p>With similar distinctions, however, were then received
a great many other plays, nowadays equally unknown and
obscure. The disproportion between the enduring merits of
a literary production and the admiration lavished upon it
by its contemporaries was, at the time in question, most
conspicuous in the field of the drama. The history of the
whole 18:th century drama in England is, with a few brilliant
exceptions, a history of decay. From the shock that the
drama had suffered at the triumph of Puritanism in the
preceding century it recovered but slowly, and in the meantime
the cultivated public was strongly decided in favour
of the novel; while an undreamed revival was taking place
within the last-named branch of literature, the theatre long
remained a meeting-place of ordinary pleasure-hunters.
Even the advance of the actor was injurious to the drama,
the excellence of the acting offering ample excuse for the
inferiority of what was acted.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Yet the English drama<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
of the latter 18:th century, viewed in broad outlines, followed
the fiction. The spectator is taken into scenes of domestic
life where the absence of the grander elements of tragedy
is compensated with tender and always well-bred sentimentality.
Out of this <i>milieu</i>, but under the freshening influence
of classical comedy, there arose the dramatic masterpieces
of the age, the comedies of Sheridan and Goldsmith.</p>

<p>The romantic drama which came after the sentimental,
displays a spectacle still more unexhilarating. The fascination
exercised by Shakespeare upon the young romantic
movement bore fruit in the interpretations of great actors
and, a little later, in the enthusiastic comments of eminent
critics; but the playwrights could do nothing with a model
that admitted neither approach nor imitation. This was
realized by some of the dramatists themselves. Maturin
wrote,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> with reference to the sorry state of the English
drama, which he calls a phenomenon unparalleled in
the history of literature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While in every other department of literature, all means have
been employed to excite and to satiate the appetite for novelty;
while history, philosophy, and theology have contributed to enrich
and diversify poetry, while it has sought to interest us not only by
painting man in every situation in which he has yet been discovered,
but in situations in which the vivid creations of fancy alone could
give a habitation and a name, while the passions have been depicted
not only in their visible operation on life, but in the silent and unwitnessed
workings of the heart, the drama still rests her claim on
the merit of her earliest productions, and the efforts of competitors
or of imitators have only served to establish the triumphs of Shakspeare.</p>
</div>

<p>At the same time there came an influence from very
different quarters. If it was not possible to enter into competition
with the Elizabethans, there was no difficulty in
imitating writers like Kotzebue, who left his mark upon
much in the English drama of the time. Yet nothing remains
even of those who aspired higher. Joanna Baillie was the
most admired of them; Maturin quotes her often and calls
her the greatest dramatist of the age; but in our days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
‘no man reads her unless he must.’<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Until the appearance
of <i>The Cenci</i> (1819), the early 19:th century romanticism
produced not a single drama worthy of the glorious traditions.</p>

<p>Considering this desert-like state of the then English
drama, the <i>éclat</i> roused by <i>Bertram</i> is not surprising. Still
it was less due to any of its dramatical qualities than to
its closeness to the poetical standard in vogue just at the
time of its performance; the point was made by the admirers
as well as by the slanderers of the play, that it was
conceived quite ‘in the taste of Lord Byron.’ If Maturin’s
first romance had appeared a little too late, with regard
to the style in which it was written, his first drama thus
appeared at the right moment and met with the right interpretation.
Whatever the opinion of Kean may have been
of the play, he certainly realized the intentions of the poet
with a skill that left nothing more to be desired. In an
account of the first night we read:<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; it will be observed that the part of Bertram is peculiarly
adapted to the powers of Mr. Kean, by whom it is represented with
extraordinary energy and effect. He is a mixture of ambition, pride
and revenge; a character ashamed of the feelings of ordinary men,
who has little in common with them, but his passion for a lovely
woman, and in whose sorrows ordinary men of course cannot sympathize&mdash;in
short, a character who like Milton’s Satan is “himself
alone.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such is count Bertram when presented to the spectator.
Once he has been of wholly different character, while living
in the kingdom of Sicily as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The darling of his liege and of his land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The army’s idol, and the counsil’s head&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose smile was fortune, and whose will was law&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When his power, however, has become too great, and his
plans turned out to be too ambitious for the safety of the
state, Lord Aldobrand has contrived to overthrow him.
Deprived of name and fortune he has only saved his life
by flight; and the admired and accomplished courtier has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
subsequently been changed into a captain of a gang of
robbers, of uncommon ferocity. In the meantime his betrothed
bride, Imogine, a lady of comparatively humble birth,
has been induced to give her hand to the selfsame Aldobrand,
for the (not very original) purpose of saving an aged parent
from ruin.&mdash;</p>

<p>By the coast of Sicily, then, in the vicinity of the castle
of St. Aldobrand, the brotherhood of a convent are, at the
opening of the play, roused from their sleep by a violent
storm. At a short distance a vessel, to which they are unable
to render assistance, is seen to go to pieces. One wild-looking
and incoherently-speaking man alone is rescued and
conducted to the prior in a state of utter exhaustion.&mdash;At
the castle, too, the inmates are disturbed by the rage of the
elements. Lord Aldobrand himself appears to be absent,
and his lady is sitting in her apartment, contemplating
a miniature picture of Bertram. She is joined by one of her
maidens, to whom she now discloses the story of her life,
assuring her that her heart still belongs to Bertram. The
conversation is interrupted by the entrance of a monk,
coming to request that the shipwrecked of whom, contrary
to all expectation, many have been saved, might have,
according to the wonted hospitality of Lord Aldobrand, free
access to the castle. Upon Imogine answering that they
are welcome, the whole band take up their residence at
the castle; before that, however, Bertram&mdash;the stranger
who was first saved&mdash;reveals his identity to the prior and
vows vengeance on Aldobrand, the originator of his misfortunes.
At the castle the majestic form and stern demeanour
of Bertram attract the notice of Imogine, and she summons
him to her presence. A scene of recognition takes
place. Imogine explains her reasons for becoming the wife
of Aldobrand; Bertram breaks out into furious accusations,
but at last, when Imogine’s little boy runs in, he relents
and kisses the child.</p>

<p>These are the contents of the first two acts. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
third Imogine arrives to the convent to confess to the prior
that she has yielded to the temptation offered by the unexpected
appearance of Bertram, and clandestinely met him
several times. The prior&mdash;who, in the foregoing scene,
has been exhorting Bertram to give up his companions and
leave the country&mdash;is much horrified and recommends
the most severe penances. While still at the convent, Imogine
encounters Bertram and is made to promise him one
further interview, after which he is to disappear from her
life. The act is again closed by the entrance of the child,
who comes to inform his mother that Lord Aldobrand has
returned.</p>

<p>At the meeting intended to be their last, Bertram then
appears to have taken advantage of Imogine’s weakness
in a manner which even he is ashamed to recollect. Before
he has time to execute his design of departing, he is informed
by one of his gang that his being in Sicily has become known
and that Lord Aldobrand holds a commission from the
king to seek his life throughout the country. Bertram is
again filled with inexorable rage towards his enemy, and
remembers his determination to have revenge upon him.&mdash;In
the meantime Aldobrand arrives at his castle where Imogine
receives him in an agitated manner which he in vain
endeavours to fathom. On her declaring that she has some
penance to do, he leaves her alone; after a while Bertram
enters, and she understands, with horror, that he is resolved
to destroy her husband. Aldobrand has, indeed, just been
summoned to the convent to share a feast in celebration
of St. Anselm, but, owing to a flood which obstructs his
way, he is compelled to turn back. On his return he is
attacked by Bertram, and dies at the feet of Imogine.</p>

<p>In the fifth act the tidings of the murder of Aldobrand
are brought to the convent by Imogine, who, in a frantic
state of mind, rushes in which her child. The monks and
the knights of St. Anselm hasten to the castle. Bertram
has locked himself up in a chamber where he has passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
all the night with the dead body; at the summons of the
prior, however, he opens the door and suffers himself to be
arrested.&mdash;The last scene is laid in a dark wood where
Imogine, who has lost her reason, is lingering in a cavern.
The way which leads Bertram to the place of execution passes
by the cavern, and he, who has up till now shown no
repentance, sinks down when he hears the piercing shrieks
of Imogine. She comes out and expires at the sight of him,
whereupon Bertram snatches the sword of one of the knights
and stabs himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a drama, <i>Bertram</i> is not well constructed. The plot
is curiously void of consistency and inner logic; when the
talk is interrupted by action, it seems to happen more or less
at random. The effect of the shipwreck in the first act is
destroyed by the sudden appearance of all the banditti who
are saved in a manner altogether inexplicable and whose
preservation, moreover, is quite unnecessary. They do not
in any way interfere in the events; Bertram kills Aldobrand
with his own hands, and when the deed is done, he receives
no help from his companions: they disappear from the play
as mysteriously as they enter it. The final determination
of Bertram to take Aldobrand’s life is very imperfectly
accounted for. He must, surely, have been aware that
Aldobrand, if cognizant of his presence, would adopt vigorous
measures for his persecution, whence his sudden rage
when informed of this is rather surprizing. He exclaims,
with reference to the calamity he has brought over Imogine:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas but e’en now, I would have knelt to him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the prostration of a conscious villain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would have crouched beneath his spurning feet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would have felt their trampling tread, and blessed it&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I had injured him&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but then he forgets that Aldobrand knows nothing of his
relation to Imogine, or his repentance, or even of the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
that he has promised the prior to give up his trade and
retire where the voice of man is never heard. Here, however,
it must be mentioned that in the original manuscript
of the play, Bertram is prompted to the committal of his
crimes by an evil spirit who dwells in the forest and whom
he insists on visiting. After his visit to the demon he seems
so altered, and the stamp of an intercourse with a supernatural
being is so visible upon him, that his own robbers
shrink from him. These passages Maturin expunged on the
advice of Scott, and, accordingly, made respective alterations
in his play, though he consented to do so with great reluctance.
The scenes in question were afterwards published
by Scott in another connection;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> he bestows high praise
on their poetical beauty and hints, by way of comparison,
at the effect produced upon Macbeth by the appearance of
the witches. His motive for recommending Maturin to suppress
them was that they were, in his opinion, unsuitable
on the stage.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Generally speaking, a psychological argumentation
certainly is, in a drama, preferable to a direct
interference of a supernatural being who never appears
himself; but here this argumentation is so weak that there
also is some truth in the remark of another critic,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that
without those scenes ‘the change from the Bertram of the
second act to the Bertram of the fourth is inexplicable.’
Thus in either version the decisive point in the action is
unsatisfactorily motived. Nor is it difficult to detect other
implausibilities and makeshifts of a clumsy kind. The road
of Aldobrand to the convent, for instance, is stopped by
a flood which he is unable to cross even on horseback&mdash;because
he must, some way or other, be brought back
to the castle; but the flood does not hinder Imogine, the
same night, from making the same journey on foot, carrying
her child to boot. The child is introduced into the
play in order to make an end of the second and third
acts; what it has got to say sounds very unnatural. All
the finales are ineffective, not least that of the fifth act.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
When Bertram has stabbed himself the prior rushes to
him:</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in <i>Montorio</i> the last words
of the hero were an expression of joy at the fact that he did
not perish on the scaffold. Here the sentiment is repeated,
but it is clearly not fortunate to put it in the mouth of the
hero himself; if there is any relief brought about by his
nobler mode of dying, the spectator ought to feel it spontaneously.&mdash;</p>

<p>It has already been seen, more than once, that the merits
of Maturin’s works are not in their composition. The traces
of his power which there admittedly<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> are in <i>Bertram</i>, are
to be sought in richness of language and originality of style.
Now and then, amid the ‘sound and fury’ of the whole, passages
stand out where Maturin’s blank verse attains a sombre
beauty of its own, while it expressively strikes the note
of the time, vibrating with a genuinely romantic sense of
loneliness, melancholy, and grandeur. Lines such as these,
from the first interview of the hero with the heroine, doubtless
did much to decide the partiality for <i>Bertram</i> of critics
like Byron and Scott:</p>

<p>The omitted passages relative to Bertram’s dealing with
the fiend of the forest are interesting for their novelty in
Maturin. The supernatural element is here conceived in
a manner quite alien to the Gothic Romance; it serves,
in fact, to bring home a characteristic difference between
the last-named movement and romanticism. It was the
business of the ‘terrific’ school to trace the fear and horror
aroused by unearthly apparitions in ordinary men; while
in romantic poetry men of uncommon mould (like Byron’s
Manfred) are, in consequence of their intercourse with spirits,
made to grow still more distant from their neighbours
and become themselves an object of awe in their unapproachable
grandeur. Such is the case with Bertram after his
visit to the demon, the description of which Scott found
to be ‘executed in a grand and magnificent strain of poetry:’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The achievements of Bertram, as represented on the stage,
bear, indeed, too much resemblance to the doings of a common
ruffian, and he stands, both morally and poetically,
on a lower level than any of Byron’s personages, though
maintained, by reviewers,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> to be ‘that same mischievous
compound of attractiveness and turpitude, of love and crime,
of chivalry and brutality, which in the poems of Lord Byron
and his imitators has been too long successful in captivating
weak fancies and outraging moral truth.’ Yet he undoubtedly
is a hero; and though Maturin later calls him one of
his worst characters, he ought not, at the time, to have been
surprised at being accused<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> of ‘exciting undue compassion
for worthless characters, or unjust admiration of fierce and
unchristian qualities;’ It is, above all, in his capacity of
a fallen angel that Bertram had old-established claims
upon the interest and indulgence of the English public. Of
his fall this account is given by Imogine:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">High glory lost he recked not what was saved&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With desperate men in desperate ways he dealt&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A change came o’er his nature and his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till she that bore him had recoiled from him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor know the alien visage of her child.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This dismal change is regarded in a very ‘Miltonic’ light
especially by the prior, who, himself represented as well-nigh
a saint, could not but be supposed to express the view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
of the author. The impression that the hero makes upon
the mind of the prior finds voice in eloquent outbursts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">High-hearted man, sublime even in thy guilt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose passions are thy crimes, whose angel-sin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is pride that rivals the star-bright apostate’s.&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wild admiration thrills me to behold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An evil strength, so above earthly pitch&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Descending angels only could reclaim thee&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is uttered before Bertram has murdered Aldobrand;
but that being done, the exaltation of the venerable prelate
remains the same:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This majesty of guilt doth awe my spirit&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it th’embodied fiend who tempted him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sublime in guilt?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh thou, who o’er thy stormy grandeur flingest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A struggling beam that dazzles, awes, and vanishes&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou, who dost blend our wonder with our curses&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why didst thou this?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is the great fault of Bertram as a dramatic character,
that he so poorly upholds the high attitude assigned to him by
others, and that his imposing qualities chiefly rest on declamatory
effects. As a poetical figure he occasionally becomes,
thanks to life antecedents, surrounded with a gloomy splendour
exciting the kind of admiration so keenly resented by
critics who felt themselves called upon to extend their verdict
to the moral side of the question. The heroine was,
though unjustly, comprised<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> in the condemnation of the
pernicious tendency of the play:&mdash;‘it is too much the taste
of the present day, to bring forward the guilty passion of
a wife for her paramour &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; not, indeed, with direct
admiration, but in such a manner, and with such a mixture
of virtuous remorse and high-toned feeling, that we cannot
hate the crime. Now a heroine who commits adultery certainly
was a startling phenomenon on the English stage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and it was the occurrence of this offence which is said<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
finally to have caused <i>Bertram</i> to be put aside. Yet in the
play there is no connivance at the frailty of Imogine. When
she comes to unburthen her heart to the prior, this arbiter
of morals has nothing but harsh words for her; he sees
nothing sublime in <i>her</i> guilt, which at the end plunges her
into the deepest misery. In the preface to his next play
Maturin says, with reference to the shock he had given with
the story of Imogine: ‘If Tragedy is not allowed to exhibit
crimes and passions, what is left for her to exhibit?&mdash;If
crime is attended with punishment as its consequence, I
conceive the interests of morality are not compromised’&mdash;but
he was not aware that it is sometimes the criminal more
than the crime that the guardians of the interests of morality
desire to hate.&mdash;Otherwise Imogine is sketched with something
of Maturin’s skill at depicting female character, and
hers is, as Kean observed, the principal part in the play
as far as histrionic powers are concerned. Her reviving
passion for Bertram, her misery and repentance are developed
in a language comparatively free from the tinge of melodrama,
and sometimes pervaded with a deep and natural
feeling, like her confession to the prior:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Last night, oh! last night told a dreadful secret&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The moon went down, its sinking ray shut out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The parting form of one beloved too well.&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fountain of my heart dried up within me,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With nought that loved me, and with nought to love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I stood upon the desert earth alone&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I stood and wondered at my desolation&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I had spurned at every tie for him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hardly could I beg from injured hearts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The kindness that my desperate passion scorned&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in that deep and utter agony,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though then, than ever most unfit to die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I fell upon my knees, and prayed for death.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The character of Aldobrand, little as he appears, is drawn
with peculiar skill. He is an excellent man and has brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
about the ruin of Bertram out of disinterested zeal for state
and sovereign; in private life he is kindness itself and greatly
revered by all, not least by his wife. It might seem as if
the author had unnecessarily hazarded the <i>sublime</i> element
in Bertram by making his enemy a man of worth; but
where, then, would be the <i>guilt</i> in knocking down a rascal?
Considering the character Bertram is intended to support,
Aldobrand could hardly be otherwise, and he is, in all his
respectability, somehow made clearly to display a total
want of those brilliant and interesting traits the absence of
which is his only disadvantage by the side of the hero.&mdash;Other
characters to speak of there are not in the play. It
is incomprehensible how Charles Nodier<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> could ascribe so
important a part to the prior: ‘cependant c’est le Prieur
qui est le héros de la tragédie, et son calme sublime contraste
avec le désordre et les passions des corsaires, comme l’immobilité
de ses antique murailles avec l’agitation des flots,
domaine inconstant de ce peuple désespéré.’ The prior really
presents an extraordinarily sorry figure. His calmness&mdash;which
asserts itself only when action is required; in words
he is as tempestuous as Bertram&mdash;is most akin to inertness,
not to say imbecility. He is from the first initiated into
Bertram’s vindictive designs against Aldobrand&mdash;who is
a great friend of his&mdash;and does nothing to prevent them
except talking in a way which gives vent to his fantastic
admiration for Bertram, very unnatural in a person of
his character and situation. His high-flown comments
upon the hero are, throughout the play, nothing short of
ridiculous, which they by no means are meant to be.
It was, however, quite in keeping with the romantic
spirit to introduce the convent into the turbulent scenes
as an asylum of peace, inhabited by good and holy men&mdash;in
contradiction to the Gothic Romance, where a
convent usually is described as a nest of all sorts of
devilry. This is the only instance in Maturin’s work where
the milder view prevails; he was, in <i>Melmoth</i>, soon to return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to the terrific style again with a force seldom equalled in
literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The motive of adverse circumstances driving a high-souled
man to become a captain of robbers is most famous
from <i>Die Räuber</i> (1781) of Schiller. In that drama Gustave
Planche<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> finds the ‘idée mère’ of <i>Bertram</i>, though he
prefers the latter play:&mdash;‘les mêmes idées, qui dans Schiller
resemblent à une dissertation, prennent dans Maturin la
forme vivante et animée d’une légende surnaturelle, et cette
différence suffirait pour établir la supériorité de <i>Bertram</i>
sur les <i>Brigands</i>.’ It is, however, difficult to see where, in
<i>Bertram</i>, the ideas of <i>The Robbers</i> come in at all. The drama
of Schiller is, despite its bombastic language, a typical
18:th century production with a social tendency. The hero
and his followers are&mdash;as in the case of the theorizing ‘Arcadian’
robbers in Godwin’s <i>Caleb Williams</i>&mdash;revolting
against the constituent principles of society, the perverseness
of which alone has occasioned their desperate enterprise;
but the enterprise is, after all, discovered to be an
unjustifiable means of changing the existing state of things.
In <i>Bertram</i> there is nothing of the 18:th century. The adventure
presented to the spectator is of a quite individual character,
the case being applicable to the hero and no one else.
He does not want to reform society; he does not place himself
at the head of a gang of robbers on any ideal grounds;
he falls. Nor are his companions robbers of the chivalrous
type who keep a court of honour among themselves and take
from the rich to give to the poor. Bertram himself says
to some of them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">&mdash;ye are slaves that for a ducat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would rend the screaming infant from the breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To plunge it in the flames.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The play thus aims at nothing but the poetical exhibition
of a man blending sublimity in guilt. The catchword of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Karl Moor expresses his determination to surrender himself
to justice, that is, voluntarily to meet the ‘felon death’
which Bertram, in his last cry, rejoices at having escaped.
In all this there would appear, in <i>Bertram</i>, not a formally
different application, but a total absence, of the ideas of
<i>The Robbers</i>, and any influence from Schiller seems uncertain.&mdash;In
some detached passages of <i>Bertram</i> critics tried to
detect loans from several obscure plays, from Shakespeare,
and even from Scott; but excepting the fact that <i>The Tempest</i>
necessarily is called to mind by any play opening with
a shipwreck, these loans are unimportant. The treatment
of the other principal motive, the marriage of Imogine to
the enemy of her lover, shows less originality. Its model,
as pointed out in the <i>Irish Quarterly Review</i> 1852, is to be
found in a play called <i>Percy</i> (1778), by Miss Hannah More.
This was one of the first English dramas where the action
is placed in romantic surroundings, although it resolves
round the favourite topics of the day.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Percy, Earl of
Northumberland, is the lover and destined husband of Elwina,
daughter of Earl Raby. For some offence Raby
breaks off all relations with Percy, who subsequently joins
a crusade. During his absence Raby compels his daughter
to marry Earl Douglas, an inveterate foe of Percy, and
shortly after that the hero returns to England. Elwina,
on one occasion, relates the story of her misfortunes to her
maid, which passage has a direct correspondence in <i>Bertram</i>.
The most conspicuous resemblance, however, is afforded
by the scene where Elwina meets Percy and discloses to him
that she is the wife of Douglas. Percy, like Bertram, is
seized with a violent fury, and his words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And have I ’scap’d the Saracen’s fell sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only to perish by Elwina’s guilt?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>are distinctly echoed in Bertram’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And did I ’scape from war, and want, and famine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To perish by the falsehood of a woman?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p>The further development of the conflict is, as easily can
be imagined, totally different in the two dramas&mdash;a heroine
of Hannah More was the least likely of any to suggest the
character of the lady Imogine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is generally asserted by biographers<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> that contemporary
critics&mdash;with the single exception of Coleridge&mdash;were
‘enraptured’ about <i>Bertram</i>; but this, undoubtedly,
is to say too much. Its supposed immoral tendency, as has
already been seen, roused a storm of indignation in the
columns of the reviews, where the passing acknowledgments
of the author’s talent almost vanished. The opening lines
of the criticism in the <i>Eclectic Review</i> are characteristic of
the way in which the play was treated of:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This tragedy has obtained, upon the stage, a popularity that
would seem altogether undeserved. That the Author has strong
powers no one can doubt; and as we are not uncandid, the reader
will find in the course of our extracts, passages that prove him to
have <i>very</i> strong powers. The piece might be objected to for its
want of dramatic interest, for the bad taste of its poetry, but its
principal fault, (in the absence of which objection indeed, we should
quietly have left it to its fate,) is its vicious and abominable morality.</p>
</div>

<p>Nor were the opinions even of those very strong powers
always undivided. While the <i>British Review</i> makes mention
of ‘vivacious touches of a very glowing pencil’ and pronounces
that ‘the description as well as the pathetic force of many
passages is admirable, and the rhythm and cadence of the
verse is musical, lofty, and full of tragic pomp’&mdash;the
<i>Monthly Review</i> maintains that the language is ‘strained,
inverted, and bombastic on many occasions,’ and that ‘the
versification, also, is often rough and imperfect; and a want
of <i>keeping</i>, of harmonious <i>colouring</i>, and, we fear, of just
<i>design</i>, is visible throughout.’ The severest attack upon
Maturin’s play, however, was delivered by Coleridge<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in
an article uniting much cutting sarcasm with savage and
indiscriminating abuse. It was supposed that Coleridge was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
irritated by the rejection of his <i>Fall of Robespierre</i> in favour
of <i>Bertram</i>; in that light the article was, at least, regarded
by Byron,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> who refers to it in a letter to Murray, dated
October 12:th 1819:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Coleridge’s Life, I perceive an attack upon the then Committee
of Drury Lane Theatre for acting Bertram, and an attack
upon Maturin’s Bertram for being acted. Considering all things,
this is not very grateful nor graceful on the part of the worthy autobiographer;
and I would answer, if I had <i>not</i> obliged him. Putting
my own pains to forward the views of Coleridge out of the question,
I know there was every disposition on the part of the Sub-Committee
to bring forward any production of his, were it feasible. The play
he offered, though poetical, did not appear at all practicable, and
Bertram did&mdash;and hence this long tirade, which is the last chapter
of his vagabond life.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not quite clear in what manner Coleridge had been
obliged, his play never appearing on the stage. If his criticism
of <i>Bertram</i> was dictated by disappointment, that must
have been galling indeed, for the tone prevailing in it is
exceedingly acrimonious.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Every blunder in the composition,
and unhappy turn of phrase in the impetuous style&mdash;not
over-difficult to expose&mdash;is made the most of and the
whole play torn to fragments, scene by scene, cleverly
enough, but with a rancour which really conveys the impression
of proceeding from a personal cause. The critic’s virtuous
horror at the incidents is worked up to a pitch that
leaves all other reviewers far behind; even the circumstance
of Imogine, before she has recognized Bertram, sending
for him and speaking to him, <i>alone</i>, is represented as a piece
of gross indelicacy!&mdash;and if any spectator felt inclined to
take a fancy to the hero, it certainly was no fault of Coleridge’s,
who characterizes him, in a single breath, as ‘this
<i>felo de se</i>, and thief-captain, this loathsome and leprous
confluence of robbery, adultery, murder, and cowardly
assassination, this monster &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;.’</p>

<p>However, some nonsense though these reviewers utter,
their opinion of Maturin’s first play comes nearer to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
final valuation than that of many later writers who boldly
prophesied the author’s lasting immortality on account
of <i>Bertram</i>. Among admiring biographers whose verdict
was unsupported by any literary authority, there were
critics of some reputation; Gustave Planche, writing in
1833, does not hesitate to say that <i>Bertram</i> contains scenes
worthy of <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i>. In opposition to this enthusiasm
of the French, it is interesting to note the very sound
judgment of Goethe. He had, in 1817, read the play and
written a kind of advertisement of it, in which he reaches
in a few words the kernel of the matter and explains the
secret of its success: ‘Das neuste englische Publikum ist in
Hass und Liebe von den Dichtungen des Lord Byron durchdrungen,
und so kann denn auch ein <i>Bertram</i> Wurzel fassen,
der gleichfalls Menschenhass und Rachegeist, Pflicht und
Schwachheit, Umsicht, Plan, Zufälligkeiten und Zerstörung
mit Furienbesen durcheinander peitscht und eine, genau
besehen, emphatische Pose zur Würde eines tragischen
Gedichtes erhebt.’<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One result of the success attending <i>Bertram</i> was&mdash;the
play being produced anonymously&mdash;that several individuals
began to make claims for the authorship. This circumstance
contributed to Maturin’s determination to emerge
from his anonymity and publicly take his place among the
men of letters of his day. With regard to any further professional
preferment this was definitely to burn his boats:
a clergyman of the established church the writer of a play
whose morality was generally pronounced to be an abomination.
On the other hand the dream of his life now seemed
realized, and the way open to the circles to which he felt
himself to belong. He took the step; and, in order to make
the most of it, accepted an invitation from London to come
over to witness the triumph of his production. This was
the only journey of any length ever undertaken by Maturin;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
if not very adventurous, it still was something of an enterprise
at that time, when a crossing between Dublin and
Liverpool could take up to 36 hours. Maturin’s stay in
London did not exceed a month. He arrived there in the
latter part of May, and the 22:nd of June he wrote, from
home, his first letter to Murray, in acknowledgment of the
kindness shown him by the publisher. In the <i>New Monthly
Magazine</i> 1827 we read that Maturin was, while in the metropolis,
‘suddenly elevated to the most dizzy and flattering
distinction,’ being ‘caressed by the first men of the day,
recognized by the audience during the performance of his
play, and received with acclamations.’ The language, however,
in Maturin’s own letters referring to his reception is
very different, and suggestive rather of a disappointment.
Even in his first letter, when sending his respects to
Mrs. Murray, he assures his correspondent that ‘to your
friendly and hospitable attention I am indebted for the
only pleasant hours passed during my sojourn in London.’
In another letter, from July 6:th, he returns to the theme
with marked bitterness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I should be particularly obliged by your letting me know at
your leisure, and as a <i>friend</i> (in which light I shall always consider,
and feel my obligations to you) whether the impression I made in
London was favourable or otherwise, or, whether <i>I made any impression
at all</i>. My reason for urging this strange question is, <i>the marked
coldness of my reception at every house but yours and Lord Essex’s</i>,
and the singular circumstance of my never being invited to Mr.
Lamb’s. I am aware that long struggle with distress and difficulty
will not only cloud the mind, but degrade the manners of
the sufferer, but still I cannot but think that my habits and conduct
could not justify my exclusion from the line of society to which I
was born, and in which till latterly I have always lived.</p>

<p>When you have time to write, tell me if my apprehensions are
true, and if I was really though unfit for the company of men who
invited me over and on whose hospitality and courtesy I had therefore
some claim during my very short stay.</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of a soothing answer from Murray, the idea
that he had not appeared to advantage continued to haunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Maturin. It ought to be mentioned, however, that in the
letter quoted above there is an allusion to a member of the
fair sex upon whom the impression made by the Irish guest
seems to have been even more favourable than he could
have wished&mdash;yet at the same time something to gratify
the vanity of which he had, perhaps a little more than
the usual allotment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have received a letter from&mdash;since my return to Ireland. I
really would be glad of your advice in this unpleasant business.
I dread her resentment if provoked, and <i>I am determined not to answer
her letters</i>. I wish it could be intimated to her that I was in the
country and never received her Epistle&mdash;you know what Congreve
says of “woman spurned.”&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Bertram</i> was the first of Maturin’s works that appeared
with his name. It was published by Murray, and ran through
seven editions in the course of 1816; the current price of
3 sh. for a new play was on this occasion raised to 4 sh. 6 d.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Together with the profits of the performance, the sum
cleared by Maturin for his tragedy is said to have amounted
to £ 1000. The consequences, however, of the unhappy
transaction in which he had been involved some years before,
disagreeably asserted themselves at this piece of good luck,
and he speaks of his affairs in a pessimistic tone. In a letter
to Murray dated August 19:th he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>There is not a shilling I have made by Bertram that has not been
expended to pay the debts of a scoundrel for whom I had the misfortune
to go security</i>, so here I am with scarce a pound in my pocket, simpering
at congratulations on having made my fortune.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet, if Maturin had not made his fortune by his first
tragedy, he probably intended to make it by his second,
for he took no pains to undeceive his congratulators. He
was, by all accounts, somewhat dazzled by the bright prospects
he imagined to be dawning for him, when he returned
to Dublin as the greatest of its literary celebrities, and he
changed his mode of living accordingly. He was, as appears
from his letters to Murray, under the impression of being
born to a line of society embellished by elegance and refinement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and his recollections of the easy circumstances in
which he had grown up had not vanished amid the privations
of later life. After his arrival from London Maturin plunged
into the delights of society and became a conspicuous
figure in saloons and assemblies; and his unpretending
house in York Street was re-furnished and decorated with
a splendour of which a friend of his who, however, admits
that he did not see Maturin’s home until a later period,
when the whole show had disappeared, gives the following
account:<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The walls of the parlours were done in panels, with scenes from
his novels, painted by an artist of some eminence; the richest carpets,
ottomans, lustres, and marble tables ornamented the withdrawing-rooms;
the most beautiful papers covered the walls, and
the ceilings were painted to represent clouds, with eagles in the
centre, from whose claws depended brilliant lustres.</p>
</div>

<p>In this abode&mdash;whether it exactly answered to the above
description or not&mdash;was then received what Dublin society
had to offer not only in the way of intellect, but preferably
of youth and beauty. What it was that attracted Maturin
in his social intercourse is vividly described by his biographer:<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is from this period that we may date the commencement
of that folly of which Maturin has been lavishly accused. Whatever
might have been the levities of his conduct before, now they
certainly became more remarkable. His whole port and bearing
was that of a man who had burst from a long sleep into a new state
of being; always gay, he now became luxurious in his habits and
manners. He was the first in the quadrille&mdash;the last to depart.
The ball-room was his temple of inspiration and worship. So passionately
attached was he to dancing, that he organized morning quadrille
parties, which met alternately two or three days in the week
at the houses of the favourite members of his <i>coterie</i>. He was proud
of the gracefulness and elegance of his dancing; his light figure, and
the melancholy and interesting air that, whether natural or fictitious,
he threw into his movements, gave a peculiar character to his
style. He was a perfect bigot in his attachment to female society;
and generally restless and dissatisfied in the exclusive company
of men. I remember meeting him at a large assembly where there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
were several beautiful women, and it was with reluctance he consented
to forego the quadrille during the interval of supper: at
supper he was uneasy and impatient although he happened to be
sitting near some very intellectual persons; at last, after a few
songs, which otherwise would have been prolonged, he started up,
and with considerable animation and effect, taking a lady by the
hand, led the way to the dancing-room.</p>
</div>

<p>A very characteristic explanation of this gaiety is given
by Mangan,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> who ascribes it all to misery arising from
unappreciated intellectual superiority. Maturin, he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash;had no friend&mdash;companion&mdash;brother; he, and the “lonely
Man of Shiraz” might have shaken hands, and then&mdash;parted. He&mdash;is
his own dark way&mdash;understood many people; but nobody
understood him in any way. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; “Man, being reasonable,
must get drunk,” observes Byron. It is an ugly line; but one that
embodies a volume of philosophy&mdash;especially if we read it in juxtaposition
with that other line, by Boileau “Souvent de tous nos
maux la raison est le pire.” The world points the finger of scorn
at the intellectual intemperate man&mdash;not reflecting&mdash;not caring
to reflect&mdash;that it is his very superiority to the world that drives
him to habits of intemperance. His nature is “averse from life” &mdash;he
has an impatience of existence. Charles Lamb rushed forward,
and forced the Gates of Death; and, actuated by a similar feeling,
Maturin trod in his footsteps, though only trippingly. Lamb found
his Lethe in the quart&mdash;Maturin sought his in the quadrille. One
drank, the other danced. They were the two kings of Brentford
“smelling at one nosegay,” only each experienced the sensation of
a different odour from the flowers.</p>
</div>

<p>Although the view applied by Mangan is too gloomy
a one, it contains, no doubt, a certain amount of truth, and
shows a remarkable penetration of Maturin’s character and
situation. In his correspondence of that time Maturin
repeatedly laments just his want of a literary friend or
companion, and the absence of ‘excitement of any description’
that might inspire him to carry on his poetical occupations.
As far as these were concerned, his spirit found
little nourishment in his environs. Dublin was then rather
void of literati, and the people he mixed with were, for the
most part, of the usual, every-day character. Feeling thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
that even the elite did not attain to the intellectual level
he commanded, Maturin turned to the lighter style of social
life&mdash;with real pleasure, as it corresponded to one side of
his temperament, but sometimes, it is not unlikely, with
a feverish intensity affording oblivion of the disadvantages
under which he laboured, and escape from the melancholy
that also was a constituent part of his mind. His nervousness
might have been increased by doubts as to the duration
of his present mode of existence, and at intervals there
naturally came moments of weariness and <i>tedium vitae</i>.
In his sermon preached on the first Sunday of the year 1817
Maturin exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yes, disappointment has been, <i>must</i> be, the result of our pursuits
and passions, because they were “of the earth, earthly;” because
of their very nature they were hollow, worthless, and false, and they
communicated that nature to their object&mdash;they were unworthy
of the energies of a thinking spirit, unworthy of the dignity of an
immortal soul! &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; What is the result of the chase of these lying
vanities? We are disappointed, either in failing to attain them,
and thus being rendered wretched by the loss of that whose possession
never could have made us happy; or&mdash;more mortifying to
the illusions of our pride, by attaining them, and finding their possession
to be emptiness, yea, “worse than nothing, than vanity.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sentiments like these implied a general condemnation
of the pursuits Maturin himself was engaged in all his life,
and give one more illustration of the tragic contradiction
between his profession and his inclinations. That the eccentricities
of his conduct incurred a great deal of censure on
the part of the more rigorous-minded has already been
hinted; but his placidity of temper and easy, gentlemanly
manners usually disarmed the displeasure of those coming
into contact with him, and he had, upon the whole, no
personal enemies. In his own parish he was universally
beloved, and where his well-known figure emerged it attracted
friendly attention, not unmixed with amazement.
His outward appearance used to vary according to his conditions.
When he could, he dressed in the highest fashion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
his cash being at a low ebb, he would be seen walking about
in a costume almost ostentatiously shabby. ‘Mr. Maturin’
says a writer,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> ‘was tall, slender, but well proportioned,
and on the whole, a good figure, which he took care to display
in a well made black coat, tight buttoned, and some
old light-coloured stocking-web pantaloons, surmounted in
winter by a coat of prodigious dimensions, gracefully thrown
on, so as not to obscure the symmetry it affected to protect.’
The portrait of Maturin, drawn by Brocas, which
appeared in the <i>New Monthly Magazine or Universal Register</i>
1819 and which is reproduced in the 1892 edition of
<i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>, shows a self-portraying and uncommonly
handsome face: the finely chiselled mouth indicating
a tendency towards the gay and luxurious, while the
gaze of the large and melancholy eyes suggests the horrors
his imagination was wont to dwell upon. Those who saw
him in his home were struck by the former quality greatly
prevailing over the latter, as is told by a visitor:<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I found him in a large and rather well furnished drawing-room,
seated at a writing-desk; while the table on which the
desk rested was heaped with books and papers, scattered there in
a state of most delectable confusion. He was clad in a sort of loose
morning gown, which had evidently been in use for many years.
He was cravatless, and looked at the moment rather pale and emaciated.
At this period he was at the heyday of his literary popularity,
and it struck me that he looked like one who had been enjoying
the good things of life (enjoying them too freely) the night before.
His eldest boy was seated at his right hand, copying out something
from a sadly blotted M. S. Mrs. M. &mdash;&mdash;, with her daughter, occupied
a place near the window, and, when the conversation commenced,
joined freely in it. I saw before me for the first time the man of
genius, the man whose language and sentiments had operated on me
as a species of witchcraft. I felt an indescribable awe&mdash;my heart
throbbed, and my tongue was for the moment bound up; but the
cheerful welcome, the gentle tone, and the brightly animated look
of the poet, soon set me quite at ease, and after a few minutes conversation
I found myself as it were at home. I was struck most
forcibly with the contrast existing in the person and manner of the
author and his writings&mdash;the one all passion and gloominess and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
horror, the other ease, grace, and sprightliness, approaching even
to levity. He exhibited on this, and on other occasions, when I
was with him, a turn for mimicry, and a vein of humour, for which
I was entirely unprepared.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>It is mentioned in most notes on Maturin that he was
in the habit of placing a wafer on his forehead in his hours
of inspiration, to signify to his family that he was not to be
intruded upon. This&mdash;and many other caprices of a similar
kind&mdash;might have happened once or twice and then
been related at the tea-tables of Dublin as a token of the
eccentricity of their literary curate. The story of the wafer
seems to be contradicted, or at least greatly qualified, by
the statements of some other writers. Carleton<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> says that
Maturin had composed the greatest part of his earlier romances
at Marsh’s library in St. Patrick’s Close, ‘on a small
plain deal desk, which he removed from place to place according
as it suited his privacy or convenience;’ and an intimate
friend of his has said<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that he never worked on his
two last novels except in the stillness of night, when there
was consequently no fear of his being disturbed. As for the
inventive part of composition, one writer<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> reports the following
utterance of Maturin:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I compose on a long walk; but then the day must neither be
too hot, nor cold: it must be reduced to that medium from which
you feel no inconvenience one way or the other; and then when
I am perfectly free from the city and experience no annoyance from
the weather, my mind becomes lighted by sunshine and I arrange
my plan perfectly to my own satisfaction.</p>
</div>

<p>This confidence was made just on one of those long pedestrian
excursions to the county of Wicklow, which Maturin
loved to undertake, especially in autumn, his favourite season.
During his rambles he sometimes would enter into
a literary discussion&mdash;which he in general is said to have
been rather disinclined to do&mdash;and from the occasion now
in question his interlocutor has preserved some of his opinions
about the poets of England. He appears to have been
most attracted by those who presented the least points of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
contact with his own production. With Byron he shared
a boundless admiration for Pope, and of the living poets
he liked best Crabbe and next to him Hogg. He was very
fond of Moore who had, he said, done what he had wished
to do himself, had he been able; but for the poetry of Byron
he had a strong distaste, the more remarkable as he had
often, as in the case of <i>Bertram</i>, been supposed deliberately
to imitate the bard of <i>The Corsair</i> and <i>Lara</i>. What Maturin,
however, objected to in Byron’s poems was not the spirit
but the style:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I never could finish the perusal of any of his long poems. There
is something in them excessively at variance with my notions of
poetry. He is too fond of the obsolete; but that I do not quarrel
with so much as his system of converting it into a kind of modern
antique, by superadding tinsel to gold. It is a sort of mixed mode,
neither old nor new, but incessantly hovering between both.</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly may be quoted what Maturin, according to the
same writer, once pronounced upon Walter Scott whom he,
no doubt, loved best of all authors, ancient or modern:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yes, he has a most powerful genius; a genius that can adapt
itself to the changes of times and feelings with the most extraordinary
celerity, and with less than the labours of ordinary thought
can reform and remodel the literature of the age. He is the greatest
writer of his day. He writes not for England, but for all mankind;
and he has embraced in his infinite vision all modes and systems
of men and manners. What he does, he does appropriately; not
seeking to display all the varieties of his mind in any one work, but
only that which properly belongs to it: nothing is out of place;
all is perfect, simple, and real; and he possesses the magical talent
of explaining a whole character by a simple word of feeling; and of
imparting to the meanest figure in his picture the interest of a principal.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the literary plans Maturin revolved in his mind
after the success of his first play was the publication of a
new edition of <i>Montorio</i>, for which romance he still entertained
a partiality. Murray, however, did not venture a republication
of it, nor was he favourably disposed towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
a project of Maturin’s to give out a new copy of <i>Bertram</i>
from the original manuscript, containing everything that
had been omitted in the representation. Maturin seems,
at first, to have taken it for granted that this revised edition,
which he intended to dedicate to Scott, was to be issued;
‘may I beg to know,’ he writes in the letter from July 6:th,
‘why the corrected copy has not yet appeared, I am really
disappointed at this, for, exclusive of my restoring many
passages that might possibly give pleasure to the <i>Readers</i>
(though not to the Dramatic spectator) I am most anxious
that the preface, and above all the original dedication (a
debt due by gratitude to my first literary friend Mr. Scott)
should be made public.’ The question was under discussion
for some time, but after a rather irascible epistle from Maturin
dated Nov. 19:th, it was referred to no more. Maturin
was already working at a new play, and the publisher prudently
determined to wait how it would turn out before
entering into any doubtful enterprises. In a letter from
August 19:th Maturin sanguinely says that what he has
written pleases him better than <i>Bertram</i>; but at the same
time it is seen how lonely he felt in what now was to him
a provincial seclusion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let me beg of you to write to me. I cannot describe to you
the effect of an English letter on my spirits; it is like the wind to
an Aeolian harp. I cannot produce a note without it. Give me
advice, abuse, news, anything, or nothing (if it were possible that
<i>you</i> could write nothing), but <i>write</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The principal character of the drama on which Maturin
was engaged had been suggested to him, while in London,
on behalf of Kean. The tragedian was anxious to act the
part of Lear, but that was rendered improper by the mental
illness of George III; the part he wanted was, consequently,
that of an old man in a state of decrepitude and insanity,
but occupying a somewhat humbler place in society. The
experiment was hazardous in every respect. It was required
of Maturin to produce an imitation of one of the most famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
characters in literature, without one of the principal
qualifications for his greatness. A too close attendance to
the desire of the actor laid a constant restraint upon his
imagination, and thereto came some other inconvenient
considerations. Referring to the attacks upon <i>Bertram</i>,
Maturin says in his letter last quoted: ‘In my present
attempt, I shall beware of moonlight interviews, and jobs
for Doctors Commons; my Heroines shall form a complete
Coro di Vestale, and my Hero shall be guilty only of murder
and such Bagatelles.’ All this boded no good; and when
<i>Manuel</i> was brought out at Drury Lane, early in the following
year, it turned out a decided failure. Kean, finding
it but a poor compensation for <i>Lear</i>, soon lost all interest in
it, and its reception on the part of the public was a very
cold one. The general disappointment is described in a letter
from Murray to Byron, dated March 15:th 1817:<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Maturin’s new tragedy, ‘Manuel,’ appeared on Saturday last,
and I am sorry to say that the opinion of Mr. Gifford was established
by the impression made on the audience. The first act very
fine, the rest exhibiting a want of judgment not to be endured. It
was brought out with uncommon splendour, and was well acted.
Kean’s character as an old man&mdash;a warrior&mdash;was new and well
sustained, for he had, of course, selected it, and professed to be&mdash;and
he acted as if he were&mdash;really pleased with it. But this feeling
changed to dislike after the first night, for he then abused it, and
has actually walked through the part ever since, that is to say, for
the other three nights of performance &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; I met Geo. Lamb on
Tuesday, and he complained bitterly of Kean’s conduct, said that
he had ruined the success of the tragedy, and that in consequence
he feared Maturin would receive nothing. I send you the
first act, that you may see the best of it. I have undertaken to
print the tragedy at my own expence, and to give the poor Author
the whole of the profit.</p>
</div>

<p>The verdict of Byron, after he had read the play, was
equally unfavourable. ‘It is the absurd work of a clever
man,’ he writes to Murray in a letter from Venice dated
June 14:th;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> ‘as a play, it is impracticable; as a poem,
no great things.’ One admirer, however, Maturin’s second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
tragedy was destined to meet: in a subsequent letter Byron
tells<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that ‘Monk’ Lewis, to whom he had lent it, preferred
it to some extracts from <i>Lalla Rookh</i> which he read at the
same time. For his own part Byron adds: ‘Of Manuel
I think, with the exception of a few capers, it is as heavy
a nightmare as was ever bestrode by indigestion.’ This
opinion was, later on, embraced by the author himself, who
says in a letter to Murray from Sept. 27:th:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am not discouraged by the failure of Manuel; the public were
in the right about it; it is a very bad play; but I was led astray
by the folly of supposing I could adapt myself to the <i>exclusive</i> taste
of an actor in sketching a character for him. I sacrificed everything
to him, and he in return&mdash;sacrificed me.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Manuel</i>, which was furnished with the longed-for dedication
to Walter Scott, Esq. is, indeed, Maturin’s weakest
production, and very little need be said about it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Manuel, count of Valdi, is a distinguished Spaniard whose
only son, Alonzo, was born to him in the evening of his life.
Alonzo’s birth has frustrated the expectations of Manuel’s
heir and kinsman De Zelos; the latter, with his children,
is plunged into poverty and insignificance, and publicly
slighted by all his former flatterers. He has conceived a
vehement hatred against the innocent cause of his altered
conditions, which feeling, however, is not shared by his
children: his daughter Ximena is the beloved of Alonzo,
and his son Torrismond is the lover of Victoria, the daughter
of Manuel. Alonzo has, though still a youth, completely
beaten the Moors in the battle of Tolosa, and the reports
of his victory are, at the opening of the play, spreading
through the city of Cordova. Manuel summons his friends
to a feast with which he wishes to celebrate the return of
Alonzo; the family of De Zelos, too, get an invitation. At
the entertainment Manuel awaits his son with increasing
impatience, but Alonzo never makes his appearance. At
last his war-steed is heard galloping into the court-yard, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
he comes alone with blood upon the saddle and a broken
lance trailing from the stirrup. With something like an
inspiration Manuel immediately accuses De Zelos of having
murdered his son. As no traces are found of Alonzo, De
Zelos again becomes the heir to the estates of Valdi, and the
grandees once more vie with each other in fawning upon
him and feigning to disbelieve the accusations of Manuel.
They are, however, to meet in the hall of justice, and though
Manuel can produce no proof of his charge, he passionately
maintains it to be true,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">&mdash;by that whisper of the soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which to no ear but mine is audible.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>De Zelos is on the point of swearing himself to be innocent,
when, agitated by Manuel’s shrieks of perjury, he claims
a combat to vindicate his honour. Torrismond appears
as his father’s champion, and the cause of Manuel is taken
up by a stranger on the condition that he will be allowed
to depart with his vizor closed and his name unknown.
Manuel has long been hovering on the verge of madness,
and when he now sees the stranger defeated, the insanity
breaks out in all its fury.&mdash;The last act takes place at
one of Manuel’s castles in the country, whither he is banished
on account of his unproved accusations against De Zelos;
he is attended only by his daughter and two faithful followers.
In the meantime Ximena has resolved to seek
refuge in a convent in the same vicinity. Passing by the
chapel of the castle she descends into the vault when she
is informed by her guide that a requiem is just being chanted
to the soul of Alonzo. Here she is shortly afterwards joined
by Manuel. His first impulse is to kill her, but he forbears
when she declares that she has loved Alonzo; she also tells
him that Alonzo’s murderer is now within the vault. Manuel
rushes away and Torrismond, who is in pursuit of his sister,
makes his appearance. To him Ximena repeats that she
has found, lying on one of the tombs, the person who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
murdered Alonzo; he has even given her his dagger which
is furnished with the name of his employer, but made her
swear that it is not to be examined except before the judges.&mdash;At
the same time De Zelos with a large party of friends&mdash;also
in quest of Ximena&mdash;arrive at the castle. Manuel
is hurrying them to the vault when Torrismond rushes out
crying that his father is innocent. As the judges happen
to be of the party he unsheathes the dagger and reads the
name of&mdash;his father. De Zelos, in despair, stabs himself,
and Manuel, whose strength is worn out by now, expires in
fearful ravings.&mdash;</p>

<p>Throughout the four first acts the tragedy is well-nigh
deprived of all dramatic vigour by incessant interruptions
of the main plot. That consists, or ought to consist, in the
development of the fate of Manuel until his madness&mdash;like
Lear’s&mdash;breaks out after an accumulation of disappointments;
but besides there being, in every act, plenty of
dialogue to no purpose, the interest is divided among episodes
very loosely connected with the intrigue. The incidents
of the last act are prepared by such a sub-plot, bearing upon
an intention of De Zelos to marry his daughter to the chief
justice; for that reason, it must be supposed, she leaves
her home and sets out for the convent. The appropriate
arrival to the castle, however, of all the personages required,
especially that of De Zelos and his party, makes the whole
act highly improbable and its construction puerile in the
extreme. The madness of Manuel, also, is here quite insupportable,
and it is not to be wondered at that Kean could
not endure the role more than one evening. Of the characters
De Zelos is, upon the whole, the most interesting. He
is a kind of villainous Timon of Athens. When his fortune is
gone he sees how his friends turn their backs upon him; he
perfectly comprehends the worthlessness of their conduct&mdash;</p>

<p>yet instead of paying contempt with contempt, he is ready
to commit a horrible crime in order to enable himself to
re-enter their society. His lack of self-command, however,
is so exaggerated and his nervousness so evident, that no
one can be in doubt of his guilt, which is made only too
clear by several incidents long before his name is read on the
dagger. On one occasion his intended son-in-law tells him,
much to his agitation, that a Moor has mysteriously whispered
to him that De Zelos is a villain. When the unknown
champion of Manuel then is defeated, he beckons De Zelos
to him and, for a moment, discloses his face, which is black&mdash;at
the sight of which De Zelos, ‘staggering with horror,’
falls into the arms of his son. This penitent Moor, whom
De Zelos had hired to slay Alonzo, then appears to have
travelled, wounded, to the ancient family-seat of his victim,
thus adding to the number of people who, as if by appointment,
are gathering there to die. As for the two heroines&mdash;who,
according to the promise of the author, do not much
occupy themselves with thoughts of love&mdash;they are so
negligently treated that it is not quite clear what becomes
of them. When Ximena reveals her discovery to Torrismond,
she is said to be dying, but it is never explained why.
Her fate is so obscure that the unknown writer of the witty
epilogue to <i>Manuel</i>, after enumerating all the deaths occurring
in the play, ends with the following reference to her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>

</div>

<p>The most depressing quality of <i>Manuel</i>, as a production
of Maturin’s, is that its poetry certainly is ‘no great things.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
There is nothing of the breath of romance which runs through
several passages of <i>Bertram</i>. The language is, for the most
part, uninspired, and stored with hackneyed phrases and
vulgar exclamations. A description of the battle of Osma,
spoken by Manuel, was greatly admired by Alaric Watts,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
but to a modern reader it is hardly enjoyable, as appears
from the following fragment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Night hung on van and rear: we moved in darkness,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">(When the pale moon broke on the battle’s verge)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seemed as an ocean, where the Moorish turbans</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With grasp which death unlocks not!&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Critics took but little notice of <i>Manuel</i>. In the Monthly
Review<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> there appeared an article in which the play is
unmercifully cut up, and the circumstance of De Zelos’s
dagger, above all, subjected to ridicule:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is actually to be read in the play of Manuel, and (still more
trying to the faith of our posterity!) it has actually been <i>proved</i>
to be there, by representation on the stage, that a murderer by
proxy gives that proxy a dagger, with the name (not of the maker,
but) of De Zelos,&mdash;with his own name, marked on it!!!&mdash;Parson
Adams forgetting his sermons is nothing to this; no, nor his prototype,
who walked unconsciously into the enemy’s camp.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>The absent-mindedness of De Zelos is referred to in the
scene where Ximena tells her brother that she has seen
the Moor:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">An oath had seal’d his lips&mdash;he dar’d not speak it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to my hands he gave the very dagger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The villain, in unguarded haste, had giv’n him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To do the deed of blood&mdash;<i>His name is on it!</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A man of De Zelos’s vacillating character <i>might</i>, perhaps,
be imagined capable of throwing, in a moment of ‘unguarded
haste,’ his own dagger to the proxy&mdash;but the writer is quite
right in condemning the expedient: if the villain of a tragedy
is so nervous as to become ludicrous, the case is irrevocably
lost.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shortly after the performance of <i>Manuel</i>, Maturin’s
critique on Sheil’s <i>Apostate</i>, referred to before, appeared in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. The article, probably written in great
haste, and endeavouring to give a survey of the history
of drama, from the earliest times, is not particularly interesting,
though it displays extensive reading and, upon the
whole, a correct judgment. Nor was it very welcome to
the editor. Gifford is said<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> to have subjected it to a partial
re-arrangement, thinking it worth preserving on account
of a certain ‘wild eloquence.’ The criticism of the <i>Apostate</i>,
with which the article ends, is severe but not undeservedly
so; the play had been a great success on the stage with
Miss O’Neill in the heroine’s part,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> but it belonged to the
usual, ephemeral kind of the day.</p>

<p>Maturin’s own career, however, as a successful dramatist,
had now come to an end, and the fame he had so suddenly
reaped by his <i>Bertram</i> was not destined to increase in that
field. Ambitious plans and dreams of future golden times
were once again replaced by the cares and duties of ordinary
life, and the house in York Street began to be visited
by creditors instead of dancing parties. Yet the effect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
his recent failure upon the spirits of Maturin was, to judge
from his subsequent productions where his genius rose to
its highest flights, tranquillizing rather than disheartening.
Experience had taught him the futility of heeding any
prescriptions from outside; in the years to come he relied
solely upon his own instinct and produced those works for
which, in truth, he ought to be remembered.</p>

<p>The first intelligence that Maturin was contemplating
a new novel is found in his caustic letter to Murray (Nov.
1816) concerning the non-appearance of the revised edition
of <i>Bertram</i>: he mentions, in passing, that he will not have
occasion to trouble the publisher about his prose-work, as
he has been ‘honoured by the offer of a Society of literary
Gentlemen in England, to print the work at their own
expense, and to raise a large sum by subscription for the
writer.’ The prose-work alluded to was, no doubt, <i>Women;
or, Pour et Contre</i>, which appeared in the beginning of 1818.
Of the literary gentlemen nothing further was heard, but
the author seems really to have been laid under some
kind of obligation with regard to the publication of his
novel. In September 1817 Maturin states that he is beginning
to finish a novel for Mr. Constable, who has displayed
unexampled liberality in the matter; and on Nov. 17:th he
writes, likewise to Murray: ‘My novel will come out I believe
next month. The Countess of Essex has done me the
honour to accept of the dedication and an unknown friend
has remitted a considerable sum to Mr. Constable in aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
of the publication, so that I am in hopes he will have no
reason to repent his liberality to me.’ It was through the
influence of Scott that the Constables had been induced
to purchase the copyright of the book, and it is not improbable
that Scott had also played the part of the unknown
friend, though it is surprising that such generosity should
have been requisite in the present case. To Scott, too,
the publishers appealed about a difference that arose between
the author and themselves while the proofs were already
going through the press. Maturin had composed a preface
with the object of defending <i>Bertram</i>&mdash;always his favourite
production&mdash;against the attack of Coleridge, which he had
not been quite able to get over. Out of place as a tirade
of this sort unquestionably was here, it became the more
objectionable by delivering a furious counterblast upon
certain of Coleridge’s works. The manuscript being forwarded
to Scott, he replied to it with the following letter<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
which, though unfortunately the only specimen left of his
communications to Maturin, clearly shows the cordial relations
between the master of Abbotsford and his Irish protegé:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right mr10">
26:th February 1818.
</p>

<p>Dear Sir&mdash;I am going to claim the utmost and best privilege
of sincere friendship and goodwill, that of offering a few words of
well-meant advice; and you may be sure that the occasion seems
important to induce me to venture so far upon your tolerance. It
respects the preface to your work which Constable and Co. have
sent to me. It is as well written as that sort of thing can be; but
will you forgive me if I say&mdash;it is too much in the tone of the
offence which gave rise to it to be agreeable either to good taste
or to general feeling. Coleridge’s work has been little read or heard
of, and has made no general impression whatever&mdash;certainly no
impression unfavourable to you or your play. In the opinion, therefore,
of many, you will be resenting an injury of which they are
unacquainted with the existence. If I see a man beating another
unmercifully, I am apt to condemn him upon the first blush of
the business, and hardly excuse him, though I may afterwards learn
he had ample provocation.</p>

<p>I never let the thing cling to my mind, and always adhered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
my resolution, that if my writings and tenor of life did not confute
such attacks, my words never should.</p>

<p>Let me entreat you to view Coleridge’s violence as a thing to
be contemned, not retaliated,&mdash;the opinion of a British public
may surely be set in honest opposition to that of one disappointed
and wayward man. You should also consider, <i>en bon Chretien</i>,
that Coleridge has had some room to be spited at the world, and
you are, I trust, to continue to be a favourite with the public&mdash;so
that you should totally neglect and despise criticism, however
virulent, which arises out of his bad fortune and your good.</p>

<p>I have only to add, that Messrs Constable and Co. are seriously
alarmed for the effects of the preface upon the public mind as unfavourable
to the work. In this they must be tolerable judges, for
their experience as to popular feeling is very great; and as they
have met your wishes, in all the course of the transaction, perhaps
you will be disposed to give some weight to their opinion upon
a point like this. Upon my own part I can only say, that I have
no habits of friendship, and scarce those of acquaintance with Coleridge&mdash;I
have not even read his autobiography&mdash;but I consider
him as a man of genius, struggling with bad habits and difficult
circumstances.</p>

<p>Besides, your diatribe is not <i>hujus loci</i>. We take up a novel
for amusement, and this current of controversy breaks out upon
us like a stream of lava out of the side of a beautiful green hill;
men will say you should have reserved your disputes for reviews
or periodical publications, and they will sympathise less with your
anger, because they will not think the time proper for expressing it.
We are bad judges, bad physicians, and bad divines in our own
case; but, above all, we are seldom able when injured or insulted
to judge of the degree of sympathy which the world will bear in our
resentment and our retaliation. The instant, however, that such
degree of sympathy is exceeded, we hurt ourselves and not our
adversary; I am so convinced of this, and so deeply fixed in the
opinion, that besides the uncomfortable feelings which are generated
in the course of literary debate, a man lowers his estimation in the
public eye by engaging in such controversy, that, since I have been
dipped in ink, I have suffered no personal attacks (and I have been
honoured with them of all descriptions) to provoke me to reply.
A man will certainly be vexed on such occasions, and I have wished
to have the knaves <i>where the muircock was the bailie</i>&mdash;or, as <i>you</i>
would say, <i>upon the sod</i>&mdash;but it is, however, entirely upon your
account that I take the liberty of stating an opinion on a subject
of such delicacy. I should wish you to give your excellent talents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
fair play, and to ride this race without carrying any superfluous
weight; and I am so well acquainted with my old friend the public,
that I could bet a thousand pounds to a shilling that the preface
(if that controversial part is not cancelled) will greatly prejudice
your novel.</p>

<p>I will not ask your forgiveness for the freedom I have used,
for I am sure you will not suspect me of any motives but those which
arise from regard to your talents and person; but I shall be glad
to hear (whether you follow my advice or no) that you are not angry
with me for having volunteered to offer it.</p>

<p>My health is, I think, greatly improved; I have some returns
of my spasmodic affection, but tolerable in degree, and yielding to
medicine. I hope gentle exercise and the air of my hills will set me
up this summer. I trust you will soon be out now. I have delayed
reading the sheets in progress after vol. I that I might enjoy them
when collected.&mdash;Ever yours etc&mdash;Walter Scott.</p>
</div>

<p>Advice thus tactfully conveyed could not easily be resisted,
and the offensive introduction was withdrawn. The
short preface which appeared in print, though also relative
to Maturin’s other writings, was to quite a different purpose;
in it Maturin for the first time publicly owns the authorship
of his earlier romances, but only to declare them devoid
of all merit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When I look over those books now, I am not at all surprised at
their failure; for, independent of their want of <i>external</i> interest,
(the strongest interest that books can have, even in this reading
age) they seem to me to want <i>reality</i>, vraisemblance; the characters,
situations, and language, are drawn merely from imagination; my
limited acquaintance with life denied me any other resource. In
the Tale which I now offer to the public, perhaps there may be recognised
some characters which experience will not disown. Some
resemblance to common life may be traced in them. On this I rest
for the most part the interest of the narrative. The paucity of characters
and incidents (the absence of all that constitutes the interest
of fictitious biography in general) excludes the hope of this work
possessing any other interest.</p>
</div>

<p>The external incidents in <i>Women</i> are rich and fantastic
enough, as will be seen, nor does its superiority consist in
the occurrence of the characters in ordinary life, but in the
manner in which they are handled, in the penetration which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
a true poet applies to his personages, whether imaginary or
otherwise. Maturin’s modest plea for what has later been
called realism, is wound up with a passage perfectly characteristic
of his prefaces: humble in appearance, but making,
in its way, a strong appeal to the curiosity of the reader:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If this plain avowal of the want of effect in my former attempts
does not mitigate the severity of critical animadversion, I have one
more plea to offer, which I hope may prove not ineffectual, that it is
the <i>last time</i> I ever shall trespass in <i>this way</i> on the indulgence of the
public. One more attempt I shall make, and then address my “<i>valete</i>”
to the audience, with little hope of being able to add, “<i>plaudite</i>.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The story opens briskly. The hero, whose name is Charles
De Courcy, is travelling up to Dublin from some remote
part of Ireland, when, not far from the capital, the coach
breaks down. Most of the passengers stop at the village
where the accident takes place, but Charles, with the enthusiasm
of early youth, continues his way on foot. On arriving,
towards evening, at the outskirts of the town, he is passed
by a carriage of mysterious appearance; a stifled cry issuing
from within seems to indicate that some one is being forcibly
carried away. Charles follows in the same direction and, though
he soon loses sight of the vehicle, unexpectedly lights upon
its burden in a cottage which he enters to make inquiries
about his way. He is received by an old beggar-woman,
apparently a maniac, and, notwithstanding her anxiety to
get rid of him, Charles perceives, in an inner room, the
form of a young girl lying immovable, as though in a swoon.
Defying the beldam’s imprecations as well as her active
resistance, he seizes the girl and hurries out of the house.
In the darkness he successfully evades the pursuit of some
persons whom he understands to be the agents of the old
woman, and at length reaches the lodge at the gate of Phoenix
Park. A messenger despatched to town for a carriage
returns in company with a gentleman who has accidentally
heard him talk about the matter. The new-comer addresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the girl as his niece and immediately removes her in the
carriage. He also offers a seat to Charles, but makes no
further communication to him about the mystery; the whole
adventure dissolves like a dream. The exertion, however,
put forth by Charles on the occasion, throws him upon a
sick-bed where he is faithfully nursed by a friend called
Montgomery, a young man of a Methodist turn of mind.
One evening when Charles is able to walk out again, he
attends his friend to the chapel which the sect is in the habit
of frequenting; he goes there only to kill time, little expecting
that he is to meet the girl whom he rescued from the
hands of the maniac. She is greatly agitated on seeing him,
whereupon he is spoken to by an elderly lady who is with
her; though she very unwillingly alludes to the late adventure,
she kindly invites him to visit them in their house,
which invitation Charles accepts with delight, being already
very much in love with the girl. The family of Wentworth
appears to consist only of Mr. W., a wealthy man retired
from business, otherwise a bigot of a rather unpleasant
character, whose sole interest is Calvinistic controversy;
of his wife, also intensely religious, but at the same time
a woman of head and heart; and of the niece, Eva, a timid
and delicate being, who scarcely seems to belong to this
world. Charles becomes a constant visitor at the house,
yet the intercourse affords him but little satisfaction. Calvinism
is the only thing between heaven and earth the
Wentworths find worth discussing, and he soon despairs
of Eva ever being capable of any other feeling towards him
than ordinary gratitude. His strength is wasted by passion
and disappointment, and he is again seized with a serious
illness. While watching at the bedside of his delirious friend,
Montgomery comes to know of his attachment to Eva.
Montgomery is in the same predicament himself, but after
a victorious struggle with his own aspirations he reveals
Charles’s secret to his guardian&mdash;De Courcy has no family,
only bright prospects of family wealth&mdash;whom he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
thought it advisable to call to town. This gentleman goes
straight to the Wentworths, where his negotiations are
crowned with success: when Charles’s health is restored, he
is admitted into the family as the acknowledged lover of
Eva. His relations to her do not, however, undergo any
remarkable change. Eva has scarcely had courage to confess
to her aunt that Charles is not indifferent to her, and would
never dream of showing her love to any one but her Maker;
she is utterly incapable of reciprocating the enthusiastic
passion of De Courcy. Charming as she is, the narrowness
of her mind and occupations cannot but cool his ardour
in course of time&mdash;nor has the general atmosphere of the
house any attractions to offer to a young man of the world.
Charles has at once been set down by Mr. Wentworth as
a proper object of conversion, and from this topic his
conversation never departs; literature, poetry, and fine
arts are not even mentioned between them. One day then
all Dublin&mdash;except the evangelical circles&mdash;is excited
by the arrival of Madame Dalmatiani, reputed to be the
foremost singer and actress in Europe, who has been induced
to give some performances in the Irish capital. Notwithstanding
Wentworth’s remonstrations, Charles visits the
theatre every night when Madame Dalmatiani&mdash;or Zaira,
as she is called&mdash;is to appear; and it is after becoming
personally acquainted with her, that he begins to disregard
the maxim expressed in the verse which stands as the motto
to the book:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis good to be merry and wise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis good to be honest and true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis good to be off with the old love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before you be on with the new.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He is irresistibly drawn to the refined and luxurious home
of Zaira, which indeed forms a striking contrast to the
gloomy surroundings he has lately been used to. His visits
to the house of the Methodist grow less and less frequent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
and before long he becomes the most faithful attendant of
Zaira, who, on her part, is by no means unmoved by his
intense adoration. They are constantly together; once, on
an excursion to Wicklow, they encounter the old woman
who had arranged the mysterious abduction of Eva. She
addresses them with her usual impetuosity of language, and
seems to show some faint recollection of having seen Zaira
before. In the meantime the infatuation of De Courcy is
made the talk of the town and reaches even Eva in her
retirement. She courageously makes up her mind to accompany
some of her few worldly-minded acquaintances to the
theatre, and when she sees the brilliant apparition of Zaira,
she feels that she is lost. Zaira has, indeed, been informed
by Montgomery that Charles is engaged to Eva, and generously
struggles with her own affections; but when she is
leaving Ireland she at the last moment allows him to bear
her company. They are, however, not to marry at once,
but set out on a journey, during which she intends to ‘develop
his soul’ with literature and science. They first proceed to
Paris where the Allies are then assembled&mdash;the events
of the story occur in 1814&mdash;and the great metropolis is
gayer then ever. Here De Courcy for the second time shows
a tendency to forget the maxim quoted above, and an estrangement&mdash;involuntary
on the part of Zaira&mdash;takes
place between the lovers. When Montgomery appears with
the news that Eva is dying, Charles is broken down by a
fit of repentance and returns to Ireland as soon as he is able.
Notwithstanding his despair he is not allowed to see Eva,
who is fading away like a flower, in spite of most careful
medical attendance. As for Zaira, the departure of Charles
leaves her in the greatest agony of mind, cutting off the only
tie that binds her to life. She finds no longer any happiness
in the exercise of her talents; philosophy affords her no
consolation, religion has not power to heal her aching heart.
She even contemplates ending her sufferings by suicide,
but lacks the strength. Sick in mind and body she at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
betakes herself to Dublin, where she leads a very quiet
life, being chiefly engaged in works of charity among the
poor. In a miserable cottage she one evening happens to
light upon the old beggar-woman who has figured in the
course of the story. She appears to be lying on her death-bed
and has, in her last moments, sufficiently recovered
her reason to recognize her visitor and inform her that she
is her mother. The story of Zaira’s earlier life&mdash;she in
reality is a native of Ireland&mdash;is now given in one of her
own letters to a friend.&mdash;She is the illegitimate daughter
of a rich and despotic land-owner who resided in the West
of Ireland and distinguished himself by the irregularities
of his private life. Zaira was the only one of his children
he ever took any notice of; he early observed her uncommon
talents and had her instructed in everything except religion,
being himself a convinced atheist. At the age of fifteen she
was secretly married to her Italian music-master; but when
she became a mother the story could no longer be concealed
from her father, who, inconsistently enough, was so incensed
at the ‘want of principle’ in his daughter, that he expelled
the couple from his house for ever. The Italian, a heartless
rascal, separated the child from the mother and left it behind
them in Ireland. Then he took his wife to Italy where he
compelled her to go on the stage. Gradually she developed
into the greatest artist of her time, though almost unwittingly,
being always closely guarded by her husband, who reaped
all the benefit of her successes. At his death she found herself
in possession of a large property which she had earned
but never yet enjoyed. The first use she made of her newly-gained
liberty was to write to her father and inquire after
the fate of her child. The old man promised to give her
the information she wanted, and Zaira hurried to Dublin;
but scarcely had she arrived there when she learned that
her father had suddenly died without leaving any references
to the child. Having thus lost all hope of ever finding her
child, she again left Ireland in company with De Courcy.&mdash;Zaira’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
mother was, for some time, the favourite mistress
of the mighty man, but then, when she was overtaken in the
act of carrying away Zaira in order to bring her up in the
Catholic religion, he had turned her out of the house. Subsequently
she partially lost her reason, preserving, however,
a passionate devotion to her faith, and the desire of imparting
it to her descendants guided all her actions; Zaira being
out of her reach she turned her attention to Zaira’s child.
She led the life of a beggar more by choice than of necessity,
for she had, when occasion arose, means of hiring people
to carry out her schemes: once, in fact, she was quite on
the point of securing the person of her granddaughter who,
after the departure of Zaira, had been committed to the
care of a wealthy couple in Dublin, and educated as their
niece under the name of Eva Wentworth.&mdash;Thus Zaira at
last becomes acquainted with her daughter’s circumstances.
She hastens to the house of Wentworth, but arrives just
a moment after Eva has closed her eyes in death of which
her mother has been the indirect cause. Shortly afterwards
De Courcy also goes the way of all flesh, while Zaira, when
the story ends, ‘still lives,’ though a shadow of her former
self.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reproduction of the bare outlines of the story of
<i>Women</i> is an easy matter compared to that of Maturin’s
earlier novels; what Scott wrote in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
with reference to the style, is equally true of the construction
of the book: ‘We observe, with pleasure, that Mr. Maturin
has put his genius under better regulation than in his former
publications, and retrenched that luxuriance of language,
and too copious use of ornament, which distinguishes the
authors and orators of Ireland, whose exuberance of imagination
sometimes places them in the predicament of their
honest countryman, who complained of being run away
with by his legs.’ Nevertheless it is the form which, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
here, is most subject to criticism. The book can be divided
into two principal parts, the first of which comprises the
events happening before Zaira’s journey to Paris with De
Courcy, while the second is devoted to the analysis of her
mental sufferings after her separation from him; the experiences
of De Courcy in the French metropolis, and the closing
scenes in Dublin, are allowed comparatively little space.
The description of the struggles of Zaira clearly is of secondary
importance for the development of the plot, where it
thus makes a hiatus of extraordinary length. The narrative
is, besides, now and then broken by letters and discussions
all of which are not kept within proper bounds. The positive
merits, however, of each separate part of the work, more
than atone for any lack of proportion in its construction.</p>

<p>Of all the scenes in the book, those in the first part dealing
with the Methodist circles of Dublin, unquestionably
are the most interesting. Maturin often said that he was
no judge of his own works, but he was not mistaken in
seeing the main virtue of <i>Women</i> in that it bears ‘some
resemblance to common life.’ Formerly, as has been seen,
Maturin’s ideas of his special powers had led him carefully
to avoid the sphere of ‘common life,’ both in his treatment
of external incident and, still more, of emotion; but the
fact is that those powers, when ripened into maturity, were
distinguished by a versatility not to be confined to any
special style of fiction. In <i>Melmoth</i> he returned, with undiminished
powers, to the field of pure imagination, against
which the preface to <i>Women</i> denotes but a momentary
reaction. It was not, perhaps, for artistic reasons only
that Maturin, in the present work, described an aspect of
common life as led in the rigidly Calvinistic community;
the exposure of the less amiable qualities of the sect might
have been a not unwelcome side-issue for him, considering
the vast difference of his own views from those of the
‘evangelical people,’ at whose instance the peculiarities of
Maturin himself had, no doubt, received much damnation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Yet although there certainly is an under-current of satire,
that satire never has a ring of personal animosity; on the
contrary, it is relieved by a tone of genuine humour and
brightened, above all, by the introduction of the angelic
figure of Eva. The pursuits and occupations going on in
the house of Wentworth, the whole atmosphere of a place
where Calvinistic pamphlets are the only literature that is
tolerated, and the only music ever enjoyed consists of evangelical
hymns&mdash;all this is reflected in a manner the very
graphicness of which suggests impartiality. The household
bears the stamp of its master, who is incapable of cherishing
more than one idea at a time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His manners were repulsive, his understanding narrow, and
his principles inflexibly rigid; his mind was rather tenacious than
strong; what little he knew, he knew thoroughly, and what he
once acquired he retained for ever. Early in life he had made a
large fortune with a spotless character, and having retired from
business, found his mind utterly vacant; by the persuasion of his
wife, he was induced to listen to the evangelical preachers, and
(as is often the case with converts either in early youth or in
advanced life,) in a short time he far outwent his preceptors. Calvinism,
Calvinism was every thing with him; his expertness in the
five points would have foiled even their redoutable refuter, Dr. Whitby
himself; but his theology having obtained full possession of his
head, seemed so satisfied with its conquest, that it never ventured
to invade his heart.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>To a character thus formed, the abstinence from the
vanities of life costs no struggle, and implies no victory
over himself, for Calvinism is sufficient to afford him amusement
as well as edification; the most enthusiastic playgoer
could not await a first night with more eagerness than
Wentworth looks forward to an occasion upon which a
Socinian, a Catholic, an Arian, and an Arminian Methodist,
are to be exposed ‘for the whole night to the battery of a
dozen resolute Calvinists.’ In the house of Wentworth the
community naturally can feel safe from any disturbing
interferences, and it is, in fact, their habitual place of meeting.
Among the daily guests is the greatest orator of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
sect, a Tartuffian figure called Macowen, who appears to
have also a private reason for visiting the family:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was the son of a poor labourer, the tenant of a wealthy
gentleman in Cork, whose wife was evangelical; she instructed the
children of her husband’s tenants in her own system; her husband
gave her no disturbance; he followed his fox-hounds all day, and
damned his wife’s Methodism over his claret all night. The good
lady went her own way, and discovering in this lad, maugre his
fierce red hair and bare broad feet, evident marks of his being
“a growing and a gracious character” &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; She proposed a subscription
among her friends to enable him to enter the university,
and be qualified “to minister at the altar.”</p>

<p>The subscription went on zealously, and young Macowen entered
College; but when once there, <i>his views</i>, as they were called, expanded
so rapidly, that no Church Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Independent,
had the good fortune precisely to suit his sentiments in
orthodoxy of system, or purity of discipline. Thus he moved a
splendid and erratick meteor, shedding his light on the churches
as he passed, but defying them all to calculate his orbit, or ascertain
his direction. In the mean time, it had been suggested to him that
many evangelical females, of large fortune, would not be unwilling
to share his fate. This hint, often repeated and readily believed,
threw a most odious suavity into his manner; his overblown vulgar
courtesy was like the flowers of the poppy, all glare and stench.
Under these circumstances, he had become the intimate of the Wentworth
family; and from the moment he beheld Eva, his feelings
were what he could not describe, and would not account for even
to himself, but what he was determined implicitly to follow. His
system took part with his inclinations, and in a short time he believed
it a duty to impress her with the conviction that her salvation
must depend on her being united with him.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The inmost reason for Mr. Wentworth having suffered
so meritorious a wooer to be outrivalled by the unbelieving
De Courcy lies in his still being enough of a man of business
fully to appreciate the considerable property the latter is
heir to. His wife, on the other hand, is really attached
to the preserver of her ‘niece.’ She is a woman remarkable
for intelligence of mind and dignity of character; and
though her manner appears stiff and constrained by the
influence of her religion, she is naturally warm-hearted and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
loves Eva as if she were her own child. She cannot, however,
do much to enliven the heavy routine fixed by Wentworth
and Macowen, the monotony of which is broken only
by scenes like the following. De Courcy and Montgomery
call one morning when the gentlemen are sitting at the breakfast-table,
engaged in an animated controversy with a new
convert:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The muffins had been swallowed wholesale, the eggs scarcely
tasted, (though Macowen was a very good judge of eggs), and the
tea drank scalding hot, in the rage of debate, and still it raged.
Mrs. Wentworth sat at her knitting, at safe distance from the field
of battle, and Eva poured out cup after cup in silence. Macowen
had been pressing the new convert for a test of his faith; for he had
no idea of a man’s having any religion unless he could specify it under
a particular denomination, and signify his creed by a kind of free-masonic
sign, technical and decisive. This the convert refused,
it seems; and as the young men came in, he was bellowing, with
a cup of tea in his hand, which he was spilling in the trepidation of
his rage,&mdash;“No, sir&mdash;no, sir&mdash;never, never. I will neither be
Catholic or Protestant, Arminian or Calvinist.”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t put Arminian first</i>,” said Mr. Wentworth.</p>

<p>He went on.&mdash;“Neither Trinitarian or Arian&mdash;neither Universalist
or Particularist. No sir.&mdash;Sir, I will be a Christian.&mdash;Yes,
I will be a Christian, (foaming with passion). I will&mdash;I will
be a Christian.” And his voice was actually a roar, and he thumped
the table in the fury of his vociferation and the eagerness of his
orthodoxy.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Against this sombre background stand out the characters
of the principal personages. Eva, the most pathetic
among all the figures of Maturin’s creation, is drawn with
a skill almost unparalleled in the art of representing a character
in the purest and most ethereal light imaginable,
without detracting anything from an unswerving fidelity
to nature. She is as real in her goodness as in her timidity
and inexperience. She has all the passive loveliness which
can possibly flourish in such surroundings as hers, and is
completely devoid of every active quality implying any
degree of independence of mind. There is nothing brilliant
about her, and the range of her ideas is certainly narrow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
She would not think of doubting the infallibility of the
opinions expressed by Mr. Wentworth or Macowen; but for
her own part she instinctively clings to what there is best and
noblest in her religion; and what little energy she possesses
is employed, not in controversy, but in works of charity
among the children of the poor. She is never severe to any
one except herself, and shows firmness only in a punctual
attention to her own religious duties. With these she unfortunately
feels the demands of her temporal bridegroom
to be irreconcilable, and though she suffers greatly under
the conflict, she cannot find her way out of it. Her attachment
to De Courcy is true and deep; but she is, as Scott
said, ‘unable to express her passion otherwise than by dying
for it.’ A passion of so unsubstantial a description would
have put to severe trial the patience of most lovers, let
alone that of De Courcy who, at the commencement of the
story, is a young man of seventeen, without any self-denying
tendencies. The inclination of Maturin to represent his
heroes and heroines in their earliest dawn of youth sometimes
led to implausibilities, but not in the present case.
De Courcy is the most carefully sketched of all his male
characters, delineated, in fact, with a subtlety and penetration
far in advance of what the fiction of the time usually
attained. His chief characteristics are precocity and weakness;
constitutional weakness, in spite of a splendid external
appearance, and an inconsistency of mind and fickleness of
disposition constantly at war with the good and generous
qualities which the author, with impartial hand, bestows
upon him. The interest of a ‘protector’ with which he
regards Eva after their little adventure very soon and very
naturally yields to a deeper feeling which, to begin with,
knows of no pretensions. On the first occasion of his being
invited to the house of Wentworth he is plunged amid an
evangelical dinner-party, most capitally described, where
he feels but ill at ease, being the only ‘unenlightened’ person
present; the gentlemen are sitting apart, ‘on their chairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
sublime, in thought more elevate, and reason high’ in terms
which he does not even understand&mdash;and the ladies are
gathered in the drawing-room talking, for the most part,
nothing at all; but one look from Eva repays him all his
weariness and embarrasment: ‘For months after he fed
on that look; it came to him like a beam of light, and he
forgot whether it was day or night when it glanced before
his eyes.’ Yet the pleasure of feeding on a look sooner
or later <i>will</i> be exhausted, and a character like his is not
formed to bear disappointments. He is almost broken down
both in mind and body when he suspects that he is indifferent
to Eva, and when he has learned that this is not so,
the incompatibility of their views and habits seems to raise
insuperable obstacles between them. Their short hours of
confidence are always interrupted in the same way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One evening he had succeeded in prevailing on her to listen to
“The Lay of the Last Minstrel;” she was struck by the introduction,
and Charles was proceeding with that increasing confidence which
the increasing interest of a listener gives a reader, when the clock
struck, and she reminded him it was time to go to the evening
lecture at Bethesda Chapel. Charles, with a sigh, threw aside the
poem, and accompanied her. The sermon was eloquent and long,
the congregation profoundly attentive; Charles sate abstracted and
listless. As they returned, the lovely calmness of a vernal night
revived the feelings of Charles; and as Eva leaned on his arm, and
sometimes raised her looks (but with other feelings than his) to the
bright blue spangled sky, that exquisite passage broke involuntarily
from his lips, that ends with, “for lovers love the western star.”</p>

<p>Eva started, started with actual terror; she felt the name or
language of love like a profanation of the moment, and told him that
she was trying to recollect the substance of the sermon she had
just heard, and impress it on her memory. Charles was silent; and
silently accompanied her home, where nothing but the sermon was
spoken of, and every division and subdivision of theological subtlety
was run on it to exhaust the hour that must intervene till the bell
was rung for the servants to attend the family devotions, and a long
extempore prayer from Mr. Wentworth concluded the night.</p>
</div>

<p>There is, in the purity and innocence of Eva, something
sublime that often makes Charles himself feel it almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
a crime to intrude upon her with too vehement declarations
of a worldly passion. The result of this is, however, that
they never ‘love like lovers,’ and it is shown with much
psychological insight how they gradually glide away from
each other by reason of an unnatural spiritualization of
their mutual relations. Their estrangement is subsequently
hastened by the appearance of Zaira, whose society Charles
from the first imprudently cultivates. In the person of
Zaira critics have been wont to see an expression of the usual
‘extravagance’ of Maturin’s writings. Yet allowing for some
casual exaggeration of her great talents, the general characterization
stands on a very high level. The figure is not
new in Maturin&mdash;both Lady Montrevor in <i>The Wild Irish
Boy</i> and Armida Fitzalban in <i>The Milesian Chief</i> are studies
of this kind; but Zaira is depicted with a moderation and
veracity infinitely superior to either. She is none of those
distinguished dilettantes that have acquired their accomplishments
conveniently in their leisure hours; she is a
professional artist and has attained her prominence through
hard and unremitting work&mdash;work which, as a matter
of fact, is the only way to the pinnacles of art. Her character
is naturally noble, and she is free from all haughtiness
and caprice. Under the bitter sorrow she has sustained,
her heart has remained pure and tender, yearning ever for
love which she has never met with. In the isolation she has
suffered during the greater part of her existence, her mind
has been cultivated and her abilities developed at the
expense of her experience in practical affairs; she has
become curiously unfamiliar with real life and displays, on
several occasions, a naiveté almost equal to that of Eva
herself. This contrast between her superior intellect and
her incapacity of extricating herself from the difficulties of
common life is presented with an exquisite skill, and to it
she owes the tragedy of her fate. Zaira’s attachment to
De Courcy originates, on her part, in a need of tenderness
that has nothing to do with passion. The news of the loss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
of her child throws her into a desolation of mind in which
she first receives his enthusiastic admiration with a feeling
inspired by the instinct of self-preservation. She says in
a letter to her friend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How often! oh, how often! gazing on his perfect form, have
I wished that, if it were possible, such had been the child I lost,
such were the child I found! It is impossible, I feel, for the heart
long to be vacant. One image filled mine for many years, and the
very length and intensity of those feelings created a habit of the
heart, which it might have been fatal to my existence, or my reason,
not the have indulged.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>From this, indeed, there is but a short step to love,
though she is, characteristically enough, herself the last
to become aware of it. Knowing that Charles is engaged
she tries to persuade herself that what she feels for him is
only friendship which can well be extended to her rival;
and she succeeds in building up a theory in which she, at
the time, firmly believes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The friendship, which will be the charm of my future existence,
will be purified and ennobled by the certainty that the object of
it is devoted to another, to whom he will shortly be united; and
the security which is enough to satisfy my own heart, I do not hesitate
to offer to the world careless whether it will accept or reject it.</p>

<p>But if the world could ever read a heart, the innocence of mine
would astonish and convert it. At this moment, my whole pile of
future happiness rests on the foundation of theirs&mdash;Yes, of <i>theirs</i>.
To see two beings, equally amiable, <i>equally beloved</i>, enriched by my
fortune&mdash;improved by my talents&mdash;and elevated by the distinction
which I have not dishonourably attained, would be not only
beyond all I have ever enjoyed, (alas! that has been but little hitherto,)
but all that I have even conceived. I shall feel like the happy
genius, who constructed a palace of gems for the favoured Aladdin
and his bride, and then was seen no more.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Her correspondent, a Frenchwoman of fashion, at once
understands the situation; and her letters&mdash;which are
very cleverly written and present an amusing mixture of
frivolity and acute observation&mdash;tear down the theory of
Zaira and open her eyes to the state of her own feelings.
Once acknowledged, these feelings, rapidly grow stronger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
and the end, in spite of desperate attempts at bridling her
passion, is what has been told.&mdash;Neither does Charles
leave Eva without a great deal of honest and painful struggling
against his new infatuation, though he knows that his
strength is not to be relied upon. He is induced to make
a final appeal to Eva in a fine scene&mdash;: she is frightened
by a thunderstorm into a swoon when Charles, supporting
her, hears her whisper something about his intention of
forsaking her&mdash;which she purposely never alludes to. The
situation vividly reminds him of their first meeting, and his
tenderness for her takes hold of him once more:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Desert you&mdash;never, never&mdash;May the lightning strike me first!&mdash;Forsake
you&mdash;never, never&mdash;Eva, my beloved&mdash;beloved of my
soul&mdash;Yes, warm your cold cheek on mine; yes, rest your dear,
dear head on my bosom; do not let its beatings startle you&mdash;Yes,
twine your lovely fingers in mine&mdash;It is a heart that loves
you, yours is prest to; it is a hand that soon will be yours you
clasp&mdash;Why do your fingers wander so wildly among my hair,
my love? one ringlet of yours is worth all that ever&mdash;And how
often has this hair,” he continued wildly, “been damp with despair?
how often has it been torn in anguish, since I knew Zaira?”</p>

<p>Eva revived, and her pure feelings acting instinctively, she
started from his arms, and still pale with terror, she tried to falter
out an apology for her terrors.</p>

<p>“No,” said De Courcy, pursuing, and kneeling at her feet, “no,
you must not fly me. This is a decisive moment&mdash;a moment that
must end many struggles. Eva, already are you cold, already silent?
Is it only in terror and danger you cling to me? Is it only in the
terrible intervals of paroxysm and insensibility that I am ever
doomed to feel your arms twined round me, to hear your lips utter
my name? Already I see your countenance averted from me, the
moment it has the power to give a conscious look.”</p>

<p>And so it was; for Eva, trembling at the recollection that her
arms had been thrown round him, sat abashed and confounded.</p>

<p>“Eva, I call on you passionately, solemnly. This is the crisis
of both our destinies. Speak&mdash;tell me that you love&mdash;love me
as I wish, as I demand to be loved. Bind me to you by an irresistible
confession&mdash;make me yours for ever. One word, one penetrating
word of fire. One word of the language of the heart. Utter it,
and bless me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>Eva, struggling between her timidity and her passion, tried to
comply with, his wishes. She searched her feelings, for something
that might correspond with his. It was in vain; her pure heart
had not one image that reflected the ardour of his. Her lip knew
no language that could answer him. Distressed and perplexed,
she sat with distress and perplexity increasing, anxious to give him
some proof of her sincerity, but unable to give one that would satisfy
him.</p>

<p>“Eva, speak, do you love me?”</p>

<p>“Have I not said so?”</p>

<p>“Oh! when we love, it is so easy to pour out the proofs with
an overflowing sensibility; the heart luxuriates in those proofs of
its being deeply touched; it is oppressed by its own fullness, and
delights to communicate what it cannot bear undivided. If you
loved, Eva, love itself would inspire you with involuntary testimonies;
your very silence would be eloquence, nor would I have to kneel at
your feet for a word in vain.”</p>

<p>“What can I say?” said Eva, his doubts becoming too strong
for her fears; “is passion to be mistrusted, because its power renders,
us speechless?” And trembling at her own temerity in uttering these
words, she became silent.</p>

<p>Was De Courcy satisfied with this declaration? We know not;
for it is certain that there is an exaggerated sensibility, a sensibility
that doubts its own truth, and is better satisfied with words than
with things. It requires to be paid in its own coin, and would rather
hear a florid sentiment than accept of the most perfect sacrifice.</p>
</div>

<p>This interview is indeed decisive: it is the last time the
passion, of De Courcy flames up in the presence of Eva.
When the hour of Zaira’s departure draws nigh he renounces
‘all engagements, all ties, and all objects’&mdash;and obtains
her permission to accompany her. He has already sent
a note to Eva begging her to forgive him if she can, in answer
to which note he receives a long letter, said by a critic<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
to be ‘for feeling, for eloquence, for heart-touching resignation,
and impassioned grief, almost unique in the language.’
The writing of this letter is made easy to her by the presentiment
that she will not overlive his desertion of her; and
her resignation is so free from all factitious generosity and
all ostentatious self-sacrifice, that the beatings of a human
heart are, as it were, audible through the lines.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>In connection with Zaira’s stay in Ireland a few glimpses
are given of the higher society of Dublin, which, no doubt,
also ‘bear some resemblance to common life.’ Maturin was,
by this time, familiar with all the circles the town could
boast of, and the drawing-room does not escape a fling of
his good-natured satire any more than the conventicle.
De Courcy is introduced to Zaira at a large evening party,
given in her honour by a Lady Longwood, the wife of one
of his guardians. The bustle excited by the presence of Zaira;
the idle expectations of a more substantial refreshment,
entertained by ‘mammas and misses’ who have been talking
themselves hungry in her praise; Lady Longwood moving
among her guests canvassing applauses for the indifferent
musical performances of her silly daughters, before the eyes
of the greatest artist in Europe: all is described with a
humour and a vivacity that makes one regret that Maturin
so seldom, in his writings, gave vent to those high spirits
by which he was distinguished in private life. One of the
finest chapters in this part of the book is further the one
containing an account of Eva’s visit to the theatre. She
is enough of a woman to feel an irresistible desire of seeing
her famous rival, but would never dare to speak about it to
her foster-parents. Going out, however, she one day accidentally
meets Lady Longwood and her daughters, with whom
she is slightly acquainted, and, summoning up all her courage,
accepts their invitation to accompany them to witness Zaira’s
last appearance on the stage. Her confusion at the
theatre where everything is new to her, the overwhelming
impression produced upon her by the brilliant apparition of
Zaira, and her anguish when she observes De Courcy behind
the scenes are analysed with a dramatic force and a marvellous
penetration into the innocent soul-life of Eva. Less
interesting, from an artistic point of view, are the scenes
taking place at the house of Zaira, chiefly filled with literary
discussions. A well-sketched personage, however, present on
most of these occasions, is De Courcy’s friend Montgomery:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
a blunt and honest character who sees with unselfish grief
that his friend is beginning to neglect Eva, and who tries to
bring him back to the way of duty by the not very chivalrous
means of endeavouring to detect and point out immoral or
blameworthy tendencies in the views and principles of Zaira.
To this end he obstinately contradicts her where he can, and
once, weary of hearing Zaira’s taste called ‘classical,’ he makes
a furious attack upon the entire classical literature, falling
upon the ancients ‘with redoutable, repeated blows, slaying
them, like Sampson, by thousands.’ These doubts as to
the excellence of one of the corner-stones of English education
roused the wrath of the critics of <i>Women</i>, who, naturally
enough, felt irritated at being told that in their own days
Horace would have been hanged and Juvenal stood in the
pillory. The method of ascribing to the author the opinions
of his personages, always applied with vigour in the case
of the Rev. Mr. Maturin, came here, for once, pretty near
the truth. It is not only in <i>Women</i> that he displays a
hostility to classical studies; in one of his sermons he speaks
of them with a marked and candid antipathy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I will say it is the black and crying sin of civilized Europe, to
compel their children to familiarize their young imaginations with
the most brutal crimes, and force their most unripened passions,
by placing them in a hot-bed of unutterable impurity. This we do&mdash;this
we have done for centuries&mdash;and this we shall answer for
in eternity. Let me propose one plain question to the admirers of
the classic writers, as they are called: If a father finds his son reading
such passages as occur in their books in his own language, would
he not fling the vile pages into the flames, and scarce think those
flames too bad for the author?</p>
</div>

<p>As Maturin himself had been, for a long time, occupied
in giving instruction in this same branch of learning, he
knew very well that the copies of the ancients committed
into the hands of British school-boys were carefully pruned
of the passages he took such offence at; and his eccentric
inveighings against the classical writers expressed, after all,
his artistic temperament rather than any zeal for morality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
His literary tastes were eminently romantic, notwithstanding
his admiration for Pope. He had accepted the revival
of Mediaevalism in all its phases; his own work began
under the auspices of Mrs. Radcliffe and ended with an imitation
of Walter Scott; and his works possess every quality
generally termed romantic. But Maturin’s <i>Women</i> affords,
at the same time, a striking proof of the fact that the romantic
writers could occasionally greatly excel in realism, though
the spirit of classicism was to them foreign and indeed
odious.&mdash;</p>

<p>The fancy of Zaira to devote a year before her intended
marriage to De Courcy to an ‘intellectual existence’ during
which she is to finish his education, is as consistent with
her ideal and theoretical cast of mind as it is inconsistent
with anything like common prudence. Paris is, moreover,
the most unfortunate place she could choose for the commencement
of her task; in the most brilliant society of
Europe not even Zaira can make so unique a figure as in
Dublin, and to the fluctuating mind of De Courcy the gay
metropolis has a thousand things to offer, calculated to
attract him more than the conversation of Zaira. Among
these is a person called Eulalie de Touranges&mdash;otherwise
unimportant, but just giving him the pleasure of a transitory
flirtation, new to his experience, and irresistible at his age.
Thus the relation between the lovers very soon becomes
constrained in a way appropriately described in a letter of
one of Zaira’s friends:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yesterday I met them at a party at our friend &mdash;&mdash;’s. The circle
was brilliant, and Zaira was unusually eloquent in literature. At
the end of a striking sentence which had called forth loud applauses
from her auditors, she looked round with a flush of triumph in her
lovely countenance for De Courcy. She saw him engaged, not in
conversation, but in delighted listening attention to the beautiful
Eulalie de Touranges. He was bending over her chair in silence.
I marked the change in her countenance, in her voice; the subsiding
of her whole figure; the gloomy vacancy of disappointment in her
expression. Her hearers did not notice it; they pressed her with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
some new remarks. She attempted to answer, but evidently did
not understand them; struggled to recover her composure, and
went on, obviously not knowing of what she was speaking. Music
was proposed soon after; and apparently determined to force De
Courcy to feel an interest in what she was undertaking, she asked
him what she should sing. He appeared not pleased at the publicity
which this application gave him, and returned some slight answer,
referring her to her own choice. She sat down. I could hear her
sigh. She turned languidly over the leaves of her music-book, and
sung an air <i>sotto voce</i> with a tone, a look, a manner unlike&mdash;oh,
how unlike Zaira! At the close of the air, she turned her head
almost imperceptibly, and saw De Courcy arranging the men on a
chess-board with Mademoiselle de Touranges. The last notes of
the air were nearly unintelligible.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The episode with Eulalie de Touranges is not the only
circumstance contributing to the alienation between De
Courcy and Zaira. The very basis of their friendship is
unnatural. No man, as Maturin simply remarks, is pleased
to be the pupil of a woman, and to be continually reminded
of the superiority of Zaira cannot fail to become irritating
to De Courcy. His <i>liaison</i> to an actress is, moreover, often
misconstrued in a way that is very disagreeable to him;
but, weak as he is, instead of resolutely defending her
honour, he only wishes to get rid of her. Once he is told
that Zaira has been married and even had a child, the fate
of whom is entirely unknown. His love to her being already
on the decline, he feels, and not quite without reason, greatly
incensed at her having never mentioned this to him. The
innocent figure of Eva begins to reappear to his mind, and
when he hears from Montgomery that Eva is lying dangerously
ill, his sensitive nature is utterly shocked at the
thought of his being the cause of her death. Nothing can
now detain him at Paris. The development of these incidents
is traced with an inner logic that makes De Courcy’s return
to Ireland appear not only natural but inevitable, and
forces the reader at once to accept the argumentation. Scott,
indeed, says in his critique on <i>Women</i> that De Courcy’s
desertion of Zaira is not ‘half so probably motived as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
first offence against the code of constancy;’ but his judgment
proceeds, no doubt, from an honest indignation at
a hero so lamentably deficient in what had always been
considered as the principal qualification of one, fidelity in
love: summing up the characteristics of De Courcy, the
author of <i>Waverley</i> concludes by wishing him to the devil.
Yet De Courcy, although the ‘hero’ of an extensive novel,
is meant to be neither admired nor hated, only understood,
and the characterization is executed with a realism which
the time was not quite able to appreciate.&mdash;As for Zaira,
she knows nothing of the art of keeping the interest of a
lover alive by occasionally exercising some reserve towards
him; it is impossible for her not to show clearly that he
is all she lives for, and this deep and serious view of their
relation would, even in itself, inspire a kind of awe in the
fickle-minded De Courcy. Now the passion of Zaira is heightened
according as that of De Courcy cools down; she is
seized with that eccentric, all-absorbing infatuation which
persons of genius sometimes conceive for objects wholly
unworthy of it. Having been kept, for a time, painfully
hovering between hope and despair, she is at last relieved
from all doubts. It happens in rather a hackneyed way:
she gets hold of a bit of paper on which De Courcy has begun
to compose an answer to his guardian who has written to
him and implored him to come back, and Zaira makes out
the words: ‘I am weary, sick to the soul of my present
situation; I shall fly from it as soon as possible.’ The lack
of originality, however, is easily forgotten in the almost
appalling power with which the sufferings of Zaira are described,
sufferings that gradually deprive her of her talents
and her health, of everything but life. Of pride she has
never had much; now she loses every trace of it. Although
aware that she is wearying him, she is still anxious to appear
in his company, and when he actually begins to shun her,
she even follows him in the street, and stealing to his hotel,
at last sees him depart. But for the tender care which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
some of her French friends take of her, Zaira would perish;
to restore her to her former vigour, however, is not in human
power. She cannot find peace in any of her old pursuits,
nothing can divert her mind from the calamity that has
befallen her. At this time she is thrown into the society
of an atheistic philosopher who, in support of his theories,
endeavours to prove to her that misery is, and must be,
the lot of all intellectual beings. Their conversations on
this subject unquestionably belong to the <i>longueurs</i> of the
book; as the adoption of his sceptical views would not,
in her present state of mind, be of any solace to Zaira, the
discourses are unnecessarily protracted, and her escape from
the ‘snares’ of the philosopher does not appear so meritorious
as is probably intended. But all the more impressively
are described Zaira’s attempts at turning to religion, seeking
consolation in a living faith. Her friends have taken
her to a beautiful villa in the country, where she has a singular
experience while roaming about in a summer night:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; The garden, with its placid regular beauty, tortured
her by its contrast to the agitation of her soul. A gate, at the extremity
of it, opened into a wood; she hurried into the wood, its darkness
was as light unto her, it seemed as a shelter from her own
thoughts, and she fled to it with avidity. Nature, in all its rich and
exhaustless luxuriance, has nothing to the eye or to the soul so delicious
as the mild splendour of moonlight, shed over the darkness
of a forest. There is darkness beneath for the unhappy to muse&mdash;there
is light above for the happy to gaze on&mdash;and the trembling
gleams between the branches give a strong image of life, chequered
indeed with fitful and precarious lustre, but of which the
predominant image is gloom&mdash;diversified, but essential.</p>

<p>Zaira wandered on; the beauty of the night, the mildness of
the climate, precluded all apprehension from her wandering at
this late hour. She found herself in a part of the wood where the
thick-mingling branches excluded all light, but a tremulous and
chequered gleam, that appeared and disappeared among the foliage
above, as it was agitated slightly by the breeze. Suddenly a figure
appeared to her in the darkness; a white figure, as large as life.
She started at first, but a moment after approached it; just where
it seemed to stand, the trees opened a little, and the moonlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
fell strongly on it, producing a remarkable and solemn effect. It
was a figure of Christ on the cross, which had been taken from a
ruined church in the neighbourhood, and placed there by the peasantry.
It was of wood, but it was well executed, and the light that
fell on it at once concealed its defects, and magnified its expression.
What an object for a mind in the state of Zaira’s!&mdash;Accident,
that had so often presented her with the most terrible omens, seemed
in this to seek to make atonement. The image of the Saviour of the
world hanging on the cross a sacrifice for mankind, surrounded
by darkness, and concentrating and reflecting the light solely from
his own figure, was an intuitive symbol of relief. She approached
it, as she would the presence of a friend. The pale and dying countenance,
the woe-bent head, the outspread arms, seemed to unite
the expression of suffering and protection&mdash;singular but intelligible
combination. None can pity but those who have suffered. “He
that suffered, being tempted, is able to succour those that are
tempted.”</p>

<p>As Zaira gazed on this figure, it seemed to live, to speak to her.
Texts of scripture rushed on her heart, as if whispered to it by the
Deity. She appeared to hear these sounds issuing audibly from the
lifeless lips of the figure&mdash;“Come unto me, all ye that are weary
and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” She obeyed the call
thus echoed from the bottom of her heart; she prostrated herself
before the cross. Her spirit was bowed down along with her body,
as she exclaimed, “Oh, my God! accept a heart that has wandered,
but longs to return to its Saviour. Purify it, regenerate it, fill it
with the love of you alone. Had it known no other but yours, it
had never been almost broken. Let your Spirit descend on it, and
aid me to struggle with that image, for which all its pulses have beat,
which has been wrapt in its very core. You alone are worthy of that
place, which a mortal has too long usurped. Vindicate it for yourself,
and set me free. Deliver me into the glorious liberty of the children
of God, unconscious of any presence, incapable of admitting any
image, but yours; dead to the world, and absorbed in God alone.”</p>

<p>But though she uttered these words, it seemed as if some inner
winding of her treacherous heart was disclosed to her, where the
image of Charles rested, and defied the power even of heaven to
displace him. It seemed to her as if she dreaded lest her own prayers
should be heard; and that if the Deity had that moment offered
to efface that image for ever from her soul, to make it as the image
of one she had never seen or seen always with indifference, she would
have shrunk from the offer, and implored any other infliction at
his hands.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>The religious inspiration Zaira has thus felt for a moment
does not return, although she passes the greater part of the
night before the Crucifix, where she is, in the morning, found
insensible. All her devotional exercises are in vain; for
as she cannot find peace in the spirit of religion, her efforts
to embrace its empty forms are also doomed to fail. She
makes some arrangements to enter a convent, but is deterred
from it after a conversation she holds with an old nun,
a resident of the place. The results of an existence that leads
to apathy and stupefaction, that deadens every feeling and
makes living automata of human beings, are displayed in
the person of the nun with all the force expressing Maturin’s
innate horror at a life in monotony&mdash;and Zaira abandons
her intention with a strong conviction that she could not
buy the salvation of her soul at the price of killing it first.
The convent was, indeed, the usual refuge of fictitious characters
in great distress; in <i>The Heart of Midlothian</i> which
appeared in the same year as <i>Women</i>, Lady Staunton&mdash;the
‘Zaira’ of that great novel&mdash;ends in a continental convent
practising all the vigils and austerities of the religion,
and is then heard of no more. Yet it would have been a
too convenient way of quenching the fire by which Zaira
is consumed, and breaking off the psychological process she
is undergoing, to shut her within the walls of a convent.
The author pursues with unfaltering consistency the restless
strivings of her powerful mind after forgetfulness which
she both wishes and dreads. Perceiving that her aim cannot
be reached in solitude, she engages in acts of private charity,
visiting the poor and sick until she is tired out. Satisfaction,
however, is denied her; it is boldly shown that a person,
however good and noble, cannot perforce make herself religious,
and that there are circumstances under which that
remedy fails, without any fault of the patient’s. Weary
to the soul, she at last decides to put an end to her life.
In all her vicissitudes, it must be observed, her nature has
remained unchanged, and with the most terrible reality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
before her eyes she still lives half in a world of theories.
She discusses the subject of suicide with her friends, and
passes some painful nights in reading accounts of the deaths
of Brutus and Cato.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Yet at the decisive moment her
reason wanders; dream and reality are blended; magnificent
visions chase each other through her delirious brain,
and on recovering she clearly remembers having seen a white
figure whom she imagines to be the Irish girl, once forsaken
for her. This figure continues to haunt her mind, and as
it is something she can concentrate her thoughts upon, it
soon becomes an <i>idée fixe</i> with her. Weak and exhausted
as she is, she travels to Dublin. From a morbid inclination
as much as for philanthropical reasons she keeps on visiting
the filthiest streets and most miserable hovels, in one of
which, as has been related, she finds her wretched mother.&mdash;</p>

<p>To this part of the book, above all others, must be applied
what Alaric Watts wrote in 1819: ‘“Women” is a work
which, with all its dullness, its monotony of suffering, and
its <i>horrible anatomy</i> of the <i>moral frame</i>, stands alone among
modern writings&mdash;there is nothing like it&mdash;its profound
and philosophic melancholy, its terrible researches into the
deepest abysses of the human heart, and of human feeling&mdash;its
daring <i>drawing the veil</i> of the “holy of holies,” while
the hand that draws it trembles at the touch, make it a work
unequalled in the list of English novels.’ This sentence was
justified; <i>Women</i> stood alone among contemporary writings.
The tendency pointed out by Watts is one which, according
to a modern writer,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> indicates the latest phase in the development
of the novel: ‘Yet I think he is but a superficial
student of the literature of recorded time who does not
note one tendency of later work, of later method, of later
procedure, of later life, as compared with earlier work,
earlier method, earlier procedure, and earlier life, which seems
to imply an underlying law. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; This law of tendency
is, in general, that the depiction of the external, objective,
carnal, precedes, in every form of expression of which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
can have records, the consideration of the internal, the
subjective, the spiritual. We go from shapes, and forms,
and bulk, and externals, to the presentation of the life
within.’ Now the growth of the ‘novel of personality’ towards
a closer representation of the ‘life within’ does not
show any remarkable progress during the second decade of
the century which, on the contrary, is marked by the rapid
rise of the historical novel. It is no wonder that the depth and
intensity with which the inner life is depicted in Maturin’s
<i>Women</i>, should make a powerful impression upon thoughtful
minds, though on the part of the larger public the book met
with the usual fate of a work in advance of its time.&mdash;</p>

<p>While Zaira is well-nigh breaking down under the inconstancy
of De Courcy, her daughter is, in Dublin, pining
away from the same cause. In the Wentworth family
things are going on in the same old style, Eva only is able
to take less and less part in the usual proceedings. The
symptoms of her disease manifest themselves in a general
weakness, alarmingly increasing. Physicians are duly consulted&mdash;sea-air
is recommended by one, mountain-air by
another. Eva submits to all with a passive smile; she has
not the least doubt that she is hastening to her grave. Soon,
indeed, this becomes evident to the rest of the family, and
Wentworth already plans what evangelical institutions might
be supported by the fortune which will probably fall to him
after Eva’s death, that is, the capital settled on her by her
grandfather. A little incident exposing, in a masterly way,
the inmost characters of the principal members of the circle,
is related in connection with a meeting where Macowen is
requested to give a ‘word of prayer.’ This gentleman, who
also has been thwarted in love, deems this a suitable opportunity
of taking his revenge, and exercises his eloquence
entirely at the expense of Eva:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash;he implored the mercy of Heaven for a wanderer who had
strayed from the fold; for one “who had forsaken the guide of her
youth, and forgotten the Covenant of her God; who had loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
strangers, and after them would go.” And as he went on, aided by
the sympathising murmur of the audience, his memory supplying
him with images, and his passions with eloquence, there was not a
single metaphor in the Old Testament descriptive of the apostacy of
the Jews from their God, that he did not apply to Eva, who, compelled
to kneel out this martyrdom, wished to sink into the earth to escape
it. This cruel holding her up as an object to a numerous circle, was
the most painful trial she had yet experienced. Wentworth thought
it excellent, and expressed much hope from the strivings of that
godly man in her behalf. Mrs. Wentworth thought very differently;
her feelings were so much outraged, she could hardly remain on her
knees; and when her husband soon after proposed Macowen to
be of a party that was to meet at their house, Mrs. Wentworth
strenuously declared, “He should not come into their city, nor <i>shoot
an arrow</i> there.” And Wentworth was not displeased with her opposition
to his wishes, because it was couched in the language of Isaiah,
whom Macowen had taught him to call the fifth evangelist.</p>
</div>

<p>One evening as Eva is sitting in her garden, De Courcy
appears before her; she swoons in his arms and, from that
moment, does not leave her bed. He besieges Mrs. Wentworth
with letters and supplications, but is no more admitted
to Eva, whose only wish is to die in peace. It is not without
much exertion of her feeble strength that she succeeds in
repelling the image of her lover from her thoughts and fixing
them on religion alone, yet at length she attains the
tranquillity which Zaira had sought in vain, and her last
moments are undisturbed by any earthly memories. The
pitiable state into which De Courcy is reduced is spoken of
in a tone evincing the author’s latent sympathy for him,
but he forbears to give any detailed relation of the end of
his hero: a character like De Courcy is interesting only
in hours of happiness and enthusiasm. And as a crowning
touch of the knowledge of the conditions of human nature
displayed in Maturin’s <i>Women</i> must be mentioned the circumstance
that Zaira remains alive. She is strong, having
never been accustomed to self-indulgence. At an age when
Eva and Charles knew no external compulsion, but were
free to follow the dictates of their feelings, Zaira was placed
face to face with real life in its sternest aspect, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
strenuous work into which she was driven, has, while she
has had strength to go through it at all, hardened her vitality
so that death touches her not when it would be most welcome.
She lives on in the painful consciousness of having
caused the death of her child, unknown and unnoticed. The
book ends with this melancholy aphorism:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When great talents are combined with calamity, their union
forms the <i>tenth wave</i> of human suffering&mdash;grief becomes inexhaustible
from the unhappy fertility of genius, and the serpents that
devour us, are generated out of our own vitals.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Women</i> is, in conception as well as in execution, the most
original of Maturin’s novels. What literary reminiscences
there may be discerned&mdash;and these are but of a superficial
character&mdash;lead, for the most part, back to his own work.
It has already been said that his second book, <i>The Wild
Irish Boy</i>, contains scenes and personages that anticipate
certain things in the present work. The hero there was
not unlike De Courcy; his affections would hover between
a brilliant mother and a pale and delicate daughter; his
friend Hammond was a very distinct prototype of Montgomery.
Hammond approves of Lady Montrevor as little as
Montgomery does of Zaira, and he also is anxious to detect
something condemnable in the opinions and conversation of
the remarkable woman who has bewitched his friend. The
imperfectly sketched characters and the clumsy composition
of <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i> are of little interest in themselves,
but they clearly show the enormous advance of Maturin’s
powers after the success of <i>Bertram</i>. In Zaira critics were
inclined to see an imitation&mdash;hostile reviewers said a caricature&mdash;of
M:me de Staël’s Corinne. Scott writes: ‘We
have &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; hinted at some of the author’s errors; and
we must now, in all candour and respect, mention one of
considerable importance, which the reader has perhaps
anticipated. It respects the resemblance betwixt the character
and fate of Zaira and Corinne&mdash;a coincidence so near,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
as certainly to deprive Mr. Maturin of all claim to originality,
so far as this brilliant and well-painted character is concerned.
In her accomplishments, in her beauty, in her talents,
in her falling a victim to the passion of a fickle lover, Zaira
closely resembles her distinguished prototype.’ All this is
true, yet the most essential point of contact between the
two characters is left unmentioned. The type was one that
had occupied Maturin’s imagination long before he wrote
<i>Women</i>; it might with as much reason be asserted that
the accomplishments and outward appearance of Armida in
<i>The Milesian Chief</i> were borrowed from <i>Corinne</i> (1807).
But one trait in Zaira, which, in all probability, was directly
influenced by M:me de Staël, is her sweetness of temper
and lack of pride&mdash;a quality which excludes from the
descriptions of her suffering the ‘frenetical’ element Maturin’s
earlier writings were noted for. Otherwise the figure
of Corinne, though depicted in a calmer style, is much more
exaggerated than Zaira: the latter is only a celebrated
actress&mdash;and a very learned woman certainly; while
Corinne is, in addition to this, a gifted painter, an eminent
poetess, and a national heroine. Of the external circumstances
of Corinne’s destiny several can be pointed out
which, no doubt, have their analogies in <i>Women</i>&mdash;the
mystery that covers her early life before she rises to the
height of fame; the unhappy issue of her attachment to
a man unworthy of her, and the final loss of her great talents.
What, however, there is most remarkable in the history of
Zaira, the minute analysis of the progress of her sufferings,
that, in short, which Watts holds forth so eloquently, has
no parallel in the book of M:me de Staël who is content only
to state the result of the mental struggles her heroine undergoes.
<i>Corinne</i> is not a novel in the same sense as <i>Women</i>;
its weight lies neither in incident nor psychology, but in its
broad-minded <i>raisonnement</i> about life and literature in the
European countries of the time. The characters are subjected
to a quite conventional treatment, and it is curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
to see how closely the death of Corinne resembles the death
of Eva, though nobody ever thought of accusing Maturin
of imitation in this respect. The observation which Maturin
makes with reference to Zaira, M:me de Staël applies to
Corinne: ‘Quand une personne de génie est douée d’une
sensibilité véritable, ses chagrins se multiplient par ses facultés
mêmes: elle fait des découvertes dans sa propre peine
comme dans le reste de la nature; et, le malheur du coeur
étant inépuisable, plus on a d’idées, mieux on le sent;’&mdash;but
nevertheless she succeeds in finding the harmony of
mind which is the natural inheritance of Eva. She fixes
her thoughts on religion alone, and, decidedly refusing to
see her lover or answer his letters, declares her only wish
to be to die in peace:&mdash;‘au moment de mourir Dieu m’a
fait la grâce de retrouver du calme, et je sens que la vue
d’Oswald remplirait mon âme de sentiments qui ne s’accordent
point avec les angoisses de la mort. La religion seule
a des secrets pour ce terrible passage.’ Maturin, on the other
hand, does not shrink from drawing the extreme conclusions
from his definition, and shows with a merciless consistency
that she who was born a Zaira can never become an Eva.</p>

<p>The originality of yet another personage in <i>Women</i>
was disputed, in so far as some critics maintained Zaira’s
mother to be a copy of Meg Merrilies in <i>Guy Mannering</i>
(1815). This romantic creation of Scott&mdash;a spinner of
intrigues in the shape of an old hag of wild manners and
questionable sanity&mdash;variations of which reappear in several
of the <i>Waverley</i> novels, was very likely to attract a novelist
of Maturin’s temperament and may have had some share
in the origin of the old Irishwoman. There is, however,
this great difference, that Meg is more of a type, the Irishwoman
more of an individual. The former, who admirably
succeeds in her plans, is a schemer by profession, a gipsy
and the leader of a whole tribe; the latter has become
what she is through a series of personal calamities, and
completely fails in the fantastic aim which she is pursuing:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
she dies in misery without having converted any of her
descendants.&mdash;Zaira’s mother is the only person in the
book who is demonstratively Irish, a representative of the
lower classes. The description of her appearance is impressive,
even terrible:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She was a frightful and almost supernatural object; her figure
was low, and she was evidently very old, but her muscular strength
and activity were so great, that, combined with the fantastic wildness
of her motions, it gave them the appearance of the gambols
of a hideous fairy. She was in rags, yet their arrangement had
something of a picturesque effect. Her short tattered petticoats,
of all colours, and of various lengths, depending of angular shreds,
her red cloak hanging on her back, and displaying her bare bony
arms, with hands whose veins were like ropes, and fingers like talons;
her naked feet, with which, when she moved, she stamped, jumped,
and beat the earth like an Indian squaw in a war-dance; her face
<i>tattooed</i> with the deepest indentings of time, want, wretchedness,
and evil passions; her wrinkles, that looked like channels of streams
long flowed away; the eager motion with which she shook back
her long matted hair, that looked like strings of the grey bark of the
ash tree, while eyes flashed through them whose light seemed the
posthumous offspring of deceased humanity,&mdash;her whole appearance,
gestures, voice, and dress, made De Courcy’s blood run cold
within him.</p>
</div>

<p>A certain ‘picturesque effect,’ intended as a token of her
nationality, is carefully preserved in all her sayings and
doings, but never emphasized so as to make her attractive
in any way. Maturin, as has been seen, was not fond of
idealizing the Irish people, and the street-types occurring
in <i>Women</i> form no exception to the rule. Otherwise <i>Women</i>
is a psychological novel without any national tendency,
notwithstanding a few patriotic sentences and political allusions
to the unfortunate state of the country. Nor is there
anything peculiarly Irish in the principal events of the book,
except in Zaira’s early history, which gives a glimpse of the
primitive and unregulated life led on a remote Irish estate
at that period. As this part, however, supplies the groundwork
for the whole fabric, Allan Cunningham<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> is not entirely
wrong in calling <i>Women</i> ‘an Irish story, wild, wonderful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
and savage, with many redeeming touches of pathos
and beauty.’&mdash;Amidst all the realism of the book, an incident
with something of a supernatural import is unexpectedly
introduced; whether this be a characteristically Irish
trait or no, a study of Maturin must take account of it. It
is told that on a pleasure-party, at the time when the
intimacy between Zaira and De Courcy is ripening into love,
he twice sees the apparition of Eva, which remains unseen
by others; and Eva, on the same afternoon, in a dream
imagines herself in exactly the same situation in which
she appears to De Courcy. This incident, mentioned in a
few words but with a remarkable seriousness, caused Scott,
in his critique on <i>Women</i>, to refer to and quote the suppressed
passages of <i>Bertram</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p>Scott’s benevolent review is one of the most pleasant
specimens of his literary criticism. Cordial praise from the
man whom he considered the greatest writer of the age,
must have occasioned much satisfaction to Maturin, so
much the more as the two other critiques which <i>Women</i>
directly gave rise to were to a very different purpose. Anything
more unintelligent than an article in the <i>Monthly
Review</i><a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> it would be difficult to find. The writer ever
probes for the moral reasons of the author’s describing this
or that, and of Maturin’s treatment of the Methodists he
comes to this wonderful conclusion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To expose the repellent and unsocial manners of this sect, who
are called in derision, levelled at their own presumption, ‘evangelical,’
seems the main moral object of the writer; and we grant
that his design, had it been executed judiciously, and fairly, would
have been praiseworthy: but it is obvious that, to attain this purpose
of discountenancing spiritual pride and gloomy superstition,
the author must not on the one hand grossly overcharge the picture
which he wishes to hold up to reprobation; nor, on the other,
must he omit to present a rational and amiable contrast, in the
person of at least <i>one</i> specimen of pure and social Christianity. In
both these points, Mr. Maturin has entirely failed.</p>
</div>

<p>Of what the writer so strongly feels the loss of, Maturin
has, in fact, given not one but three instances: what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
there of spiritual pride in Eva? or what of gloomy superstition
in Montgomery and Mrs. Wentworth? Still more
stupid is another charge against the author’s fairness, which
the writer tries to make much of. De Courcy receives,
while in Paris, a letter from his guardian&mdash;an old and
conservative clergyman who, in principle, disapproves of
dramatic art and those who practise it&mdash;in which he eagerly
dissuades De Courcy from marrying an actress. This letter,
the reviewer says, he has read ‘with equal surprise and displeasure,’
and continues: ‘We cannot conceive how Mr. Maturin,
as the countryman of Miss O’Neil, whose virtues are
the groundwork and the glory of her talents, can have
brought himself to pronounce such a sweeping condemnation
of the characters of actresses. If he should say, “These
are only arguments in the mouth of an advocate against
an imprudent marriage,” he who has been so unusually
connected with the stage should have taken some opportunity
to counteract, or to modify, the unmitigated censure.’ But
is not the whole <i>life</i> of Zaira a modification of any censure?
and is it not shown at almost every page to what a moral
superiority and greatness of soul an actress is capable of
rising? Unjust as this critique is, it is nothing to the
savage attack delivered upon the book in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> At this time the famous literary warfare between
Croker and Lady Morgan was at its hottest, and Maturin’s
friendship with the authoress&mdash;she is admiringly spoken
of even in <i>Women</i>&mdash;had, no doubt, its share in the extraordinary
venomousness of the article, which there is no
difficulty in recognizing as a production of Croker himself.
He treats the book as an intentional parody on novels in
general; but the satirical tone is often broken by bursts
of great vehemence, and ignoble allusions to Maturin’s profession
are by no means spared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Parodies, as we once before said, should be short&mdash;Mr. Maturin’s,
though admirably sustained, is too long, and we may venture
to say also that the mask is never sufficiently removed&mdash;<i>we</i> know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
that the reverend author means to be merry at the expense of novel
writers and portfolio pedants, but we regret to say that we have
heard that some persons, mistaking his book for a serious production,
have censured it as degrading, by its folly, its ignorant pedantry,
its constant fustian, and its occasional blasphemy, the character
of a clerical author; while others, equally well disposed, but more
simple, have looked upon it not only as serious but as meritorious,
and have praised it as having all the qualities of an excellent novel.</p>
</div>

<p>That Maturin’s <i>Women</i> has never been reprinted cannot
but be regarded as one of the curiosities in the history of
the English novel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the February number of the <i>British Review</i> 1818
appeared an article, by Maturin, on Miss Edgeworth’s tales
of <i>Harrington</i> and <i>Ormond</i>. It was originally intended for
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>; in his letter to Murray from Sept. 27,
1817, Maturin says that his article is ready, and only waits
an order for transmission. His first contribution to the
<i>Quarterly</i>, the critique of Sheil’s <i>Apostate</i>, which had not
met with a favourable reception, was, however, to be also
his last. In another letter, dated Nov. 17, Maturin writes:
‘I can easily comprehend a truth which your politeness
would conceal, that the inferiority and not the lateness of
my article was the cause of its rejection. I am extremely
obliged by your kindness in suggesting an application to the
British Review; I have availed myself of it and must entreat
your pardon for the trouble it imposes on you.’ At that
time Maturin was still anxious to have a place in the <i>Quarterly</i>,
little as his own production harmonized with the
views advocated by the literary staff of that periodical&mdash;though
the exceedingly inimical criticism which both <i>Women</i>
and <i>Melmoth</i> afterwards received there, probably made an
end of his desire to have any connection with it. Whatever
might have been the cause of the rejection of the article,
it appears that Murray later mediated in Maturin’s behalf
with the <i>British Review</i>, which was induced to accept it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
The article is composed after the same pattern as the critique
on Sheil&mdash;though it is far more interesting&mdash;: the development
and history of the novel is traced from its earliest
beginnings up to the new stories of Miss Edgeworth. Several
quotations have been made, in the foregoing pages, from
this typical essay of Maturin, where the Gothic Romance
is happily and enthusiastically characterized, and the great
novelists of the 18:th century mentioned with an astonishing
lack of appreciation. Miss Edgeworth, however, is highly
panegyrized; but it is quite evident that Maturin’s opinion
of his celebrated countrywoman is more akin to respect
and esteem than to ardent and genuine admiration. He
cannot conceal that she is deficient in those romantic qualities
of passion and feeling for nature, which to him mean
the highest pitch of inspiration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such is Miss Edgeworth’s sacred horror of any thing like exaggerated
feeling, or tumid language; such her anxiety for reducing her
characters, where they are not meant to be heroes, to the level of
ordinary feelings and occupations, and lowering the intoxications
of romance to a “sober certainty of waking bliss,” that she appears
as averse from the enthusiasm of nature as from the enthusiasm
of passion. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; We do “grievously suspect” that Miss Edgeworth
is one of those who would have joined with Johnson in his laugh
against the pastoral prosers who “babble of green fields;” and we
rather fear that she speaks her own sentiments in the person of
Lord Glenthorne in Ennui, when he gives all the “Beauties of Killarney
to the devil.”</p>
</div>

<p>Maturin’s criticism of the two particular, tales now under
discussion is very severe, of <i>Ormond</i> decidedly too much so.
This well-known Irish story being the very antipode of the
patriotic novels produced by Lady Morgan and Maturin,
it is no wonder it did not appeal to him. There are no soul-stirring
adventures, no breath of romance, and the ancient
glory of Ireland is not even alluded to. &mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Romantic, in the highest degree, is Maturin’s next work,
his tragedy of <i>Fredolfo</i>, which was written in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
of the year 1818. The economic success of <i>Women</i> had
bettered his circumstances, and the alluring prospect of
a successful drama once more began to loom before his
fancy. As early as January 28:th Maturin communicates
to Murray that he has been made ‘a very liberal offer to
write a tragedy for Covent Garden;’ <i>Fredolfo</i>, in all probability,
was the fruit of this offer, though it was not acted
there until April 1819. Maturin’s correspondence with Murray&mdash;that
part, at least, which is extant&mdash;breaks off in
August 1818, and there is little to tell of his life until the
appearance of <i>Fredolfo</i>, except that he was fortunate enough
to form another of those literary friendships he always
desired. Alaric Watts became, at that time, editor of the
<i>New Monthly Magazine or Universal Register</i>, where he
published his admiring article on Maturin. This article,
according to some autobiographical notes of Watts,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> brought
him the acquaintance of the novelist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have no distinct recollection of the occasion of my introduction
to this remarkable man; but I have little doubt that it originated
in my having written a memoir of him in the first series of the
<i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, to accompany a fantastic-looking portrait
of him in that periodical. He was at that time in the zenith of his
fame. At all events, I was solicited by him, in 1819, to superintend
the production, at Covent Garden Theatre, of a tragedy from his
pen, entitled “Fredolpho.”</p>
</div>

<p>The tragedy turned out a failure as complete as it was
undeserved: <i>Fredolfo</i> is not only the best of Maturin’s dramatic
compositions, but a work of considerable poetic value.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scene in <i>Fredolfo</i> is laid in Switzerland, which country
had, through Byron, become as popular with the romantic
writers as Sicily and Spain had been during the bloom of
the Gothic Romance. Fredolfo the hero is an ancient and
respected Swiss lord, who has gallantly pleaded his country’s
cause against the tyranny of Austria:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He was his country’s idol&mdash;Switzerland,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all her rescued cantons, blessed her champion;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, when he sat in council, from his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sprang Liberty, a living goddess arm’d!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor lack’d his hand the thunder to defend her.&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet he is not happy, for a crime weighs upon his mind.
Once, years ago, his solitary castle on St. Gothard had been,
during his absence, visited by the Austrian governor Wallenberg,
who on the same occasion seduced his wife. Shortly
after Fredolfo’s return Wallenberg was murdered near the
castle; the deed was done by Fredolfo, with the assistance
of one single attendant, a fiendish and deformed dwarf
called Berthold. The cries of Wallenberg, however, attracted
the attention of a young Swiss peasant, Adelmar, who was
wandering in the mountains. He rushed to the place offering
his help to the assailed party, but was himself left there,
severely wounded, without having recognized any of the
fighters. This unexpected witness to the scene now became
an object of Fredolfo’s pursuit; he had him secretly carried
away from Switzerland and compelled him to live in a foreign
country. Here he was allowed every comfort he could
desire, but his longing for his native land was too strong
for him, and at last he made his way back to Switzerland.
Knowing Fredolfo to be his pursuer he still established
himself in the vicinity of the castle, and even succeeded in
winning the love of Fredolfo’s only daughter, Urilda.</p>

<p>The play opens in the castle whither, while a violent
storm is raging, Fredolfo and his daughter are expected to
return from Altdorf. Urilda, committed to the care of
Berthold, is travelling in advance; but Berthold arrives
at the castle alone, with the intelligence that Urilda’s horse
has been frightened and carried away by a flood, together
with its burden. After a while, however, Urilda is brought
home. She has been saved by a stranger in whom she, on
recovering, recognizes Adelmar, the object of her love and
her father’s hatred. Their tête-à-tête is interrupted by the
news that Fredolfo, too, is perishing in the storm. Moved
by Urilda’s despair Adelmar departs to save her father, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
successfully helps him out of a chasm among the mountains.
He then wishes to depart without revealing himself, but as
Fredolfo insists on seeing his face, he at last flings back his
mantle. Fredolfo, on discovering by whom he has been
rescued, is seized with fury, and when they are joined by
his attendants, he commands Adelmar to be secured and
conveyed to the dungeon of the castle; only the intervention
of Urilda, who comes out to meet them, saves the life
of her lover. Fredolfo observes with intense agitation the
tender relation between Urilda and Adelmar. Now Berthold,
who has been casting his eyes upon Urilda and hates
Adelmar as a rival, eagerly advises Fredolfo to put him to
death. Fredolfo, however, sets Adelmar at liberty, and from
that moment Berthold is his implacable enemy. Soon indeed
an opportunity for vengeance arises. Wallenberg, the present
Austrian governor and son of the murdered one, makes
his unexpected appearance at the castle. He has been the
cause of Fredolfo’s bringing her daughter away from Altdorf;
he freely confesses to have ‘gazed upon the maid with
lawless love,’ but now he indicates that he will honourably
claim her hand from her father. Fredolfo summons her
daughter to answer for herself, and her answer is proudly
rejective. Wallenberg departs in rage, and Berthold offers
to bear him company, casting a look upon Fredolfo from
which he understands that he is now a lost man.</p>

<p>The first two acts, which comprise what is related above,
are, in every respect, the best part of the play. They have
the character of an introduction containing the necessary
premisses for the catastrophe that follows, but they are well
conceived and full of stirring life. In the very first scene
the tragedy of Fredolfo is alluded to by an old attendant
of his in a conversation with a minstrel, and the spectator
thus becomes aware that a gloom is cast over the life of
the hero. At the arrival of Berthold it becomes clear that
he is the evil genius of the drama; he is received by the
inmates of the castle with curses and maledictions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
when Urilda recovers from her swoon she shows equal horror
and disgust at the sight of him. Berthold has been regarding
her with indications of love, but now it is seen how
his love is changed into hatred, and thoughts of vengeance
already begin to fill his mind. From the beautiful dialogue
between Urilda and Adelmar it appears that he is the object
of Fredolfo’s dislike, which explains the agitation of Fredolfo
on recognizing his preserver. Then the scenes of the
rupture between Berthold and his master, and of Wallenberg’s
visit and departure, follow each other in well-balanced
succession. The release of Adalmar from his prison is,
indeed, somewhat undramatically executed, in so far as
Fredolfo simply sends Berthold to open the door for him,
and he disappears without any further ado; but this act of
generosity marks the stage which the mental progress of
Fredolfo has now reached. He is weary of his long struggle
against the fate that nevertheless is approaching; he feels
that his crime, however defensible, is drawing near its
punishment, and he can do no more than resignedly give
himself up to whatever is to come. The mutual relations
of Fredolfo and Adelmar are essentially the same as those
of Falkland and Caleb in Godwin’s <i>Caleb Williams</i>, another
phase of which Maturin had utilized in <i>Montorio</i>. Falkland,
too, has been driven to commit a murder under exceptional
circumstances; Caleb alone is acquainted with the deed,
and he pursues him with relentless vigour until his own
strength is wasted. The difference is that Fredolfo is already
at the beginning of the drama reduced to that state of
exhaustion in which all resistance ends, and that his crime
is known, besides to Adelmar&mdash;who, indeed, is not quite
certain whether Fredolfo was one of the nocturnal combatants&mdash;to
an enemy much more dangerous. Fredolfo shares
the general abhorrence of Berthold, but dares not dismiss
him. Berthold follows him like an evil conscience, embittering
every moment of his existence, and now endeavours
to prompt him to do away with Adelmar:</p>

<p>When Berthold hints at his feelings towards Urilda,
Fredolfo loses all self-command, and only the sudden arrival
of Wallenberg saves Berthold from immediate destruction.
He has, however, now made up his mind to desert his master.</p>

<p>In the next act Wallenberg reappears at the castle,
attended by Berthold and his guard, and accuses Fredolfo
of the murder of his father. Fredolfo is thereupon taken
to the prison of Altdorf, and Urilda suffers herself to be
dragged away with her father. Adelmar has also journeyed
to Altdorf, where he engages himself in preparing a rising
among the citizens for the rescue of Fredolfo. Here he is
seen by Berthold, who invents a ruse in order to secure him.
Wallenberg enters the prison where Urilda is tending her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
father, and pretends to have forgiven him and determined
to set him at liberty; only for the sake of appearances the
place should be stormed by the people, led by some youth
‘of bold and enterprising arm,’ for which time Wallenberg
promises to dismiss the guards. Urilda at once remembers
Adelmar and finds opportunity of sending word to him.
The following night Adelmar and his band then rush in,
but are met by Wallenberg and his soldiers, who have been
lying in wait for them. While the battle is raging, Wallenberg
re-enters the prison and, revelling in the agony of
Urilda, pronounces Fredolfo’s death-warrant. The forces of
Adelmar, however, appear to be stronger then has been
expected, and Fredolfo is really liberated, though Adelmar
himself is disarmed and captured and remains, together with
Urilda, in Wallenberg’s power.&mdash;Fredolfo is carried to
a cavern in the mountains, where he observes, with horror,
that Urilda is not with him. He implores his followers to
go back and save her, when Berthold arrives to inform
him that if he refuses to suffer his death sentence, his daughter
is to suffer it instead. Fredolfo instantly prepares to go,
but at the same time they are joined by Adelmar, who
has escaped from the prison; he has placed Urilda by the
altar of a shrine and comes now to re-gather his band. In
the meantime Wallenberg and his attendants, in vain opposed
by a prior, break into the church. As Fredolfo and his
party enter it shortly afterwards, Wallenberg snatches Urilda
up to the altar and, drawing his dagger, points it to her
breast. Fredolfo, understanding her danger, dismisses his
band. Adelmar also is induced to give up his sword to
Wallenberg: whereupon Wallenberg stabs him with the
selfsame weapon and then releases Urilda. Fredolfo now
recovers himself, rushes upon Wallenberg and mortally
wounds him. Urilda expires upon the body of her lover,
and Fredolfo alone is left alive.&mdash;</p>

<p>The last three acts are not, considered as drama, quite
abreast of the introduction. The development of the action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
is, upon the whole, made too dependent on the caprices
of Wallenberg; the purely horrible elements of the play
are dilated upon with too remarkable a predilection, especially
the demonstrations of the diabolic natures of Wallenberg
and Berthold sometimes take undue space. Before
Adelmar’s attack upon the prison, for instance, there is
a long scene filled with enticements on the part of Berthold
to get Urilda to sign a paper in the belief that it contains
an order of liberation for her father, but which paper really
is the death sentence of Adelmar. Apart from the unnaturalness
of this proceeding, it has no connection with the events
that follow: Adelmar makes his escape, and the death warrant
is no more alluded to; the sole purpose of the scene
is to bring out the excruciating pain felt by Urilda when
she is thus kept hovering between hope and fear, and the
extraordinary wickedness of Berthold. Yet notwithstanding
this and certain other awkwardnesses of a similar kind, it
is undeniable that the construction is firmer and far better
regulated than in Maturin’s earlier plays, and the place
of the hero as the central figure is well sustained by means
of the skill and moderation with which the characterization
is executed. The reader has, in fact, some misgivings that
he is to share the fate of Manuel, go mad and start raving;
but Fredolfo retains his reason to the end, and the weary
resignation that has hold of his mind lends him a dignity
and a calmness very different from the fury of his enemies.</p>

<p>What, however, raises the first two acts so far above
the rest, is the romantic glamour shed over the persons
and events, much of which fades away as the play advances.
The figure of Adelmar is an exceedingly poetic one. He
does not&mdash;like Bertram&mdash;belong to the typically ‘Byronic’
heroes; there is nothing demoniac or criminal about him.
Yet he is not bloodless or commonplace; he has an air
of romance and mystery of his own, and his speech is pervaded,
as it were, by an echo from his native Alps. He
never assumes any <i>pose</i>, for he can afford to do without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
one. His dialogue with Urilda, in the first act, contains
the best things Maturin ever wrote in verse.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the play Adelmar, though a moving
force in the action, appears only by glimpses, so that the
impression he leaves is the most uniformly favourable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
all the personages, being free from the general decline of
characterization towards the end. Urilda is altogether more
conventional than Adelmar, and does but seldom, by any
action of her own, make good the very fine things said
about her. In the second act Wallenberg says, seeing her
approach:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She comes with all that shrinking bashfulness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eloquence of motion, mute, but felt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The air around her breathes of purity;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, as she moves, her equal tread’s fine impulse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falls on the ear like harmony;&mdash;the light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That gleams on her fair locks and slender form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crowns them with hallowed glory, like some vision</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To saintly eyes reveal’d!&mdash;She is a thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To knee and worship. Beauty hath no lustre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save when it gleameth through the crystal web</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Purity’s fine fingers weave for it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then it shows like Venus from the wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fresh drops clinging to her beauty still!&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the figures of Wallenberg and Berthold, Maturin’s
unrestrained imagination within the field of the horrible
carried him to a length to which the failure of the play has
been ascribed. Talfourd,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> while admitting that it contains
‘passages of a soft and mournful beauty, breathing a tender
air of romance,’ says, with reference to these two personages:
‘In “Fredolfo,” the author, as though he had resolved to
sting the public into a sense of his power, crowded together
characters of such matchless depravity, sentiments of such
demoniac cast, and events of such gratuitous horror, that
the moral taste of the audience, injured as it had been by
the success of similar works, felt the insult, and rose up
indignantly against it.’ The same opinion has been expressed
by a later critic:<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> ‘The wickedness of Berthold the dwarf
and Wallenberg surpasses all bounds of reason. Neither is
a human being at all.’ Less depravity, no doubt, would
be sufficient, yet the question is not so much of the amount
as of an unskilful display of it; in the first two acts neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
character is unnatural, nor are they much worse than many
famous villains in literature. Wallenberg appears as a
subtly drawn tyrant of unbridled passions, accustomed
blindly to follow all his freaks; his attachment to Urilda
is hardly more than a passing caprice. His proposal for her
hand is characteristically worded:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fredolfo, hear me!&mdash;Friend, or foe, I reck not&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spite of the pride that burns upon my cheek.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spite of the blood, whose cold recoiling drops</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Refuse to flow ere they would mix with thine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spite of our nations, natures, hearts averse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all that makes me shudder while I sue,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I claim thy daughter’s hand!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A love like this is never very far from hatred, and, when
disappointed, it is naturally turned into a furious thirst
for revenge which spares neither its object nor its cherisher:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I could rend out the veins that throb for her;&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could on mine own heart fix suicide’s fangs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So they defaced that form it dares to cherish!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon these sentiments he acts, and his ‘wickedness’ is
not without consistency, only it is spread out so as to affect
the symmetry of the composition. The same is still more
true of Berthold, who, in the beginning, appears to be not
only sinning, but sinned against. It is not quite clear how
he has, previous to the events of the play, deserved the
detestation of all his neighbours; to a great extent it seems
to be inspired by his bodily deformity. His love to Urilda
is tender enough; leaning over her, when she is lying senseless,
he speaks this beautiful monologue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! it renews the heart to gaze oh thee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou thing of power, that hast not life, but givest it:&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou beautous even in death&mdash;making death beautous!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those softly closed lids, in whose rich veil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unseen light dwells lovely,&mdash;the wan cheek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid whose pallid bower death weds with beauty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The faintly-falling arms, the woe-bent head&mdash;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! still be thus! Oh, yes, be ever thus!&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While thus I see thee calm, I deem thee kind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those eyes will ope&mdash;to turn their light from me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those arms will wave, to chide me with their softness;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, oh! that lip,&mdash;that rubied cup of bliss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That flows with joy for all, pour hate on me!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of a creature who can speak like this it can hardly be
said that he is no human being at all. As for the prophecy
expressed in the last lines, it is verified the moment Urilda
revives; and as Berthold then resolves upon his vengeance
it is not difficult to understand that a being with his wild
and primitive standpoint shuns no means in order to effect
it. The part was considered an important one by Maturin,
who wished particular care to be bestowed upon it. In his
letter to Watts<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> about the performance of <i>Fredolfo</i> he
says: ‘I must revert to the part of Berthold, which is sufficiently
eccentric and extravagant. Don’t let him, on my
account, appear a ludicrous figure. Perhaps his deformity
may be best expressed by a certain savage picturesqueness
of costume, which I could sketch were I upon the spot, but
which I readily submit to your taste in my absence; but
don’t let him be ludicrous, that must be the ruin of the play.
No one could bear a <i>kitchen Richard</i>. Much depends on Berthold.’&mdash;A
certain resemblance of Berthold to Richard III
is indeed obvious. Their criminal instincts are excited by
bitterness arising from a sense of their personal disadvantages.
Some reflections of Berthold:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I could, such is my heart’s o’erflowing spleen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To all that loved, and lovely are&mdash;methinks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could, even with a look,&mdash;as thus&mdash;dart through him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The basilisk’s eye-fang&mdash;dying on the throe,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>lead (<i>mutatis mutandis</i>) back to the opening monologue
of Richard III:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I, that am rudely stamped, and want love’s majesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am determined to prove a villain &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Something of a ‘kitchen Richard’ Berthold, however, is,
inwardly if not outwardly: he is a Richard without genius
or grandeur. The same difference is noticeable in the case
of another literary figure that presumably influenced the
character of Berthold&mdash;Rashleigh Osbaldistone in Scott’s
<i>Rob Roy</i> which appeared in 1818, just at the time when
Maturin was composing <i>Fredolfo</i>. The ‘wickedness’ of Rashleigh
is by no means incomparable to that of Berthold, but
he is in possession of an intellectual power and mental
superiority which makes him the most prominent figure
in the environment in which he is depicted. Berthold,
though neither ludicrous nor unnatural, is not sufficiently
interesting to support the important part assigned to him,
having nothing to counterbalance his ‘matchless depravity.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The principal rôles of <i>Fredolfo</i> were in the best hands
at Covent Garden: Fredolfo was played by Young, Adelmar
by Charles Kemble, Berthold by Yates, Wallenberg by
Macready and Urilda by Miss O’Neill. Maturin expected
success in a kind of hopeful anxiety. His letter to Watts
of April 17, alluded to above, displays his usual overflowing
gratitude to those who took an interest in his productions,
and his inclination to speak, on such occasions, slightingly
of them himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My inestimable friend,” he begins, “I never deplored my want
of <i>l’eloquence de billet</i> before; but if I possessed all the eloquence
I do not possess, it must fail under the task of expressing my obligations
to you. How much do I not owe you, and how much am I
not proud to owe you! I have implicitly followed your advice and
written to Young. Your suggestions as to curtailment I adopt
unhesitatingly; reject and retain what you like. Present, I beg
you, my best acknowledgments to Mr. Young for his friendly zeal
for a part but little worthy of his great abilities; and in your
kindness, apologise to Mr. Charles Kemble, Mr. Macready, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
other gentlemen, for my not having had the pleasure of witnessing
their talents, and thus of qualifying myself for writing parts more
worthy of their acceptance than the wild and crude sketches of
Adelmar and Wallenberg.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fact was, however, that only Yates appeared to be
satisfied with his rôle. The failure of the play was, as Watts
proceeds to say,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> due to this indisposition of the principal
actors, to the blunders of the minor ones, and, in the public
opinion, to the last outburst of the unchivalrousness of
Wallenberg:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Miss O’Neill was cast for the principal part, but displayed little
interest in it, and did not hesitate, some three weeks before the play
was produced, to prophesy its failure. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; The immediate cause
of its damnation was the exquisitely ridiculous manner in which
one of the inferior actors advanced upon the stage, with the deliberation
of an undertaker, and apprised the audience, with the most
stoical calmness, that his master was at that moment perishing in
a snowstorm on the mountains. The stolidity of this gentleman
... and the sedateness with which he delivered himself of the following
harrowing ejaculation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My Lord! my Lord! the storm! He perishes!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>precipitated the audience into a fit of merriment from which it was
found impossible to recover them, until a gallant young officer,
having delivered up his sword to his more successful antagonist,
is slaughtered with it on the spot. This thoroughly un-English incident
so revolted the audience as to convert their merriment into
indignation, and to not another word would they listen. I had
presented to Maturin’s notice the danger of this situation; but
neither Harris, the manager, nor Macready, who took the part of
the assassin, appeared to think much of the objection. With the
exception of Yates, who made an extremely effective part of Berthold,
and Macready, always conscientious and thorough, little effort
was made for the play, and its failure was irremediable.</p>
</div>

<p>The merriment was unfortunately roused as early as in
the first act, and the many impressive scenes of the introduction
passed by unheeded. As to the offending mode
of Adelmar’s death, it takes place in the very end, after
which there is not much more to listen to, nor is it probable
that it would have been sufficient to damn the play, if the
whole had been favourably received. Now, however, <i>Fredolfo</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
was silently dropped, without even any critiques being
visible; Maturin’s career as a dramatist was practically
at an end. Watts dismisses his melancholy story with the
remark that&mdash;‘Maturin, the most impulsive and eccentric
of Irishmen&mdash;and that is saying a great deal&mdash;bore his
disappointment with some philosophy.’</p>

<p>A positive result of this philosophy was that Maturin
returned to novel-writing and produced <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>,
his most famous romance. Before coming to that,
however, a few other things remain to be noted. About
the same time as <i>Fredolfo</i> was acted, there appeared<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> some
unpublished scenes from <i>Manuel</i>. In a letter to Henry
Colburn, dated March 15, Maturin says of the extracts:&mdash;‘Detached
from the tragedy they seem to me very feeble
and I would advice you to consult a literary friend before
you venture to insert them in your Magazine&mdash;should you
publish them pray let it be in your poetical department,
they are not of importance enough to appear in any other.’&mdash;The
scenes treat of the dread of De Zelos lest his crime
should be discovered, and of Manuel in the castle where
he is banished; they are indeed of little importance, rising
in no way above the average level of this the feeblest of
Maturin’s poetical productions.&mdash;In the course of 1819
Maturin published, further, a collection of <i>Sermons</i>. Popular
as he is said to have been as a preacher, the volume did
not prove a success; it was marked by the disadvantages
of Maturin’s double vocation. ‘His sermons, too,’ says his
biographer,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> ‘betrayed the struggles of a poetical mind
endeavouring to adapt itself to the prevailing austerity of
a particular class of religionists: and, between the party
which rejected his book because it was not evangelical,
and those who would not read it because it was not a romance,
it was his fate to please neither, and fail.’ A benevolent
critic in a contemporary<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> points out a certain want
of any ‘order of arrangement’ and adds that ‘though these
Sermons, if well delivered, must have had great effect from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
the pulpit, the impression, at the same time, could scarcely
be anything else than transient.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> is nowadays considered the
work by that which its author stands or falls,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> sufficiently
explains why Maturin is only mentioned in connection with
the school of terror. The ‘terrific’ elements in <i>Melmoth</i>
are, it is true, strong enough to render it the greatest novel
of that school in the English language. All the same, it is
much too complex to be confined within the limits of one
single school, while its general purport connects it with
some of the greatest works of European literature in its
period. As for the production of Melmoth, that was carried
on under circumstances distressing and even dismal; Maturin’s
short period of opulence had passed for ever, and it
was only the silent hours of night he was able to devote
to his literary labours. His mode of composing, at that
time, has been impressively described by a friend:<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Returning late in the evening, it was then after a slight refreshment
that his literary task commenced, and I have remained with
him repeatedly, looking over some of his loose manuscripts, till
three in the morning, while he was composing his wild romance of
“Melmoth.” Moderate, and indeed abstemious in his appetites,
human nature, and the over-busy and worked intellect, required
support and stimulus, and brandy-and-water supplied to him the
excitement that opium yields to others; but it had no intoxicating
effect on him: its action was, if possible, more strange, and indeed
terrible to witness. His mind travelling in the dark regions of
romance, seemed altogether to have deserted the body, and left
behind a mere physical organism, his long pale face acquired the
appearance of a cast taken from the face of a dead body; and his
large prominent eyes took a glassy look; so that when, at that
witching hour, he suddenly, without speaking, raised himself, and
extended a thin and bony hand, to grasp the silver branch with
which he lighted me down stairs, I have often started, and gazed
on him as a spectral illusion of his own creation.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> appeared in autumn 1820 and
was, by permission, inscribed to the ‘most noble the Marchioness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of Abercorn.’ A preface<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> explains the genesis
of the book:</p>

<p>The hint of this Romance (or tale) was taken from a passage
in one of my Sermons, which (as it is to be presumed very few have
read) I shall here take the liberty to quote. The passage is this.</p>

<p>“At this moment is there one of us present, however we may
have departed from the Lord, disobeyed His will, and disregarded
His word&mdash;is there one of us who would, at this moment, accept
all that man could bestow, or earth afford, to resign the hope of his
salvation? No, there is not one&mdash;not such a fool on earth, were
the enemy of mankind to traverse it with the offer!”</p>

<p>This passage suggested the idea of “Melmoth the Wanderer.”
The Reader will find that idea developed in the following pages,
with what power or success <i>he</i> is to decide.</p>
</div>

<p>The preface ends with one of those apologies of an artist
for creating works of art, which Maturin thought proper
to make every now and then, but which do not strike one
as being over-sincere:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot again appear before the public in so unseemly a character
as that of a writer of romances, without regretting the necessity
that compels me to it. Did my profession furnish me with the
means of subsistence, I should hold myself culpable indeed in having
recourse to any other, but&mdash;am I allowed the choice?</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The preface, as will be seen, really does not give more than
a ‘hint,’ either of the story or of its hero. It is not the enemy
himself who is made to traverse mankind with the gloomy
offer; Melmoth the Wanderer is a poor mortal who has,
driven by an insatiable thirst for forbidden knowledge,
bartered the hope of his own salvation for certain privileges
not allotted to common man. Among these is the quenching
of his soul’s thirst, a life prolonged by 150 years and the
ability of rapidly performing great distances and appearing
where he pleases, unhindered by lock or bolt. His contract
with the evil one can be cancelled only if he finds another
mortal who is willing to change destinies with him. Such
mortal it soon becomes Melmoth’s sole wish to encounter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
His curiosity is perfectly satisfied; his partly superhuman
existence grows an intolerable burden to him, and he looks
with terror and anxiety towards the expiration of his term,
when he will be lost for all eternity. The greater part of his
prolonged existence is occupied in tracing out and visiting
human beings in utmost misery and wretchedness, and
tempting them to buy their temporal salvation at the cost
of their eternal, but none, ‘to gain the world, will lose his
own soul,’ and when the term does expire, Satan inexorably
claims his due.</p>

<p>Melmoth, as we are told towards the end of the story
by a clergyman who has known him in his youth, is originally
an Irishman of good family, of ‘various erudition, profound
intellect, and intense appetency for information.’ About the
year 1650 he travels in Poland and there becomes ‘irrevocably
attached to the study of that art which is held in just abomination
by all who name the name of Christ.’ After
some years the clergyman, then residing in Germany, is
summoned to a dying friend who turns out to be Melmoth.
He confesses that he has&mdash;without explaining how&mdash;committed
‘the great angelic sin,’ and has but one thing to
ask of his friend: ‘I sent for you to exact your solemn
promise that you will conceal from every human being the
fact of my death&mdash;let no man know that I died, or when,
or where.’ At an hour, predicted by Melmoth with great
exactitude, his strength begins to fail, and he becomes perfectly
cold, like a corpse. The friend then leaves him, but
afterwards, while travelling on the Continent, he is continually
haunted by rumours of Melmoth being still alive.
It is, accordingly, after his apparent death that Melmoth
has been re-animated into his new, weird existence, and
that his hopeless wanderings commence.</p>

<p>The idea of melting Faust and Mephistopheles into one
person was strikingly original, and the figure of Melmoth
keeps, in the fiction of the time, a place distinctly its own,
even if a great many minor traits, relative both to its human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
and its superhuman character, can be traced to literary
sources more or less obvious. There is Milton’s Satan,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
grand and awful in his fallen state; there is the legend
of the Wandering Jew,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> who restlessly travels from land
to land, in hope of eventually being delivered of his curse&mdash;as
does his counterpart at sea, the Flying Dutchman; there
is the Radcliffe hero, tormented by secret crimes and mysteriously
appearing and disappearing, and his successor
the Byronic hero with his large and gloomy eyes and with
his sardonic yet strangely fascinating smile; and finally
the Rosicrucians,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> so common in the imaginative tales
of the time: all these can, in glimpses, be recognized in the
Wanderer. From some contemporary stories Maturin seems
to have borrowed certain ingredients directly appertaining
to the wonderful change which Melmoth undergoes. The
incident of his apparent death recalls John William Polidori’s
story of <i>The Vampyre</i> (1819).<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The hero, who turns
out to be a vampyre living on the blood of men&mdash;or preferably
of women&mdash;is mortally wounded while travelling with
a friend in Greece, and his greatest care, like Melmoth’s,
is to conceal his death:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Swear!” cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant
violence, “Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears,
swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge
of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever
may happen, or whatever you may see.”</p>
</div>

<p>Afterwards the vampyre re-appears in society and,
thanks to the oath of his friend, succeeds in making his
sister one of his victims. Of greater importance, however,
are the impulses Maturin received from Godwin’s <i>St. Leon</i>.
Here an old man, under circumstances mysterious and but
imperfectly described, communicates to Reginald de St. Leon
the secret of everlasting youth and inexhaustible wealth.
The hero joyfully consents to relieve the old man of what
seems to be a burden to him; but almost at the very moment
the bargain is made, he becomes deeply unhappy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Methought the race of mankind looked too insignificant in my
eyes. I felt a degree of uneasiness at the immeasurable distance
that was put between me and the rest of my species. I found myself
alone in the world. Must I for ever live without a companion, a
friend, any one with whom I can associate upon equal terms, with
whom I can have a community of sensations, and feelings, and
hopes, and desires, and fears?</p>
</div>

<p>This must be indicated as one of the fundamental ideas
in <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>, also.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Maturin’s romance belongs to the stories of the supernatural
only in so far as the personality of Melmoth is concerned;
otherwise, the ‘Gothic elements’ contained in it
consist of the usual external apparatus, calculated to appeal
to the reader’s sense of ‘fear arising from objects of invisible
terror,’ as stated in the preface to <i>Montorio</i>. The book consists
of six different tales with nothing in common except
the appearance, at the critical moment, of Melmoth the
Wanderer. The whole is extraordinarily involved, and the
only means of analysis is to treat each tale separately.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>When the story begins, in 1816, a young man of the name
of John Melmoth is summoned from Dublin to the county
of Wicklow, to attend a dying uncle. John is the orphan
son of a younger brother and has passed his joyless life
alternately in an humble attic in Dublin, and on the estate
of this same uncle, an old miser, who has scarcely allowed
his young visitor food enough; he has, however, been taught
to consider himself his uncle’s heir apparent, and, consequently,
to treat him with the utmost deference. On arriving
at the country-house John finds it in a most desolate
and neglected state, as well as the miser himself, who lies
on his death-bed attended by an old village Sybil whom he
employs to avoid the expense of a doctor, and sundry
menials impatiently waiting for the death of their master
to enable them to celebrate a wake with more food and
drink than they are wont to see during a whole year. The
miser is well aware of these genial expectations, which by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
means contribute to the sweetening of his last moments.
The arrival however of John somewhat enlivens him; he
even commissions his nephew to bring him a glass of liquor
from a small closet, which John well remembers nobody but
his uncle has ever been allowed to enter. Once in the closet,
he sees on the wall the portrait of a man in middle age, whose
eyes appear to him to shed an unearthly lustre from the old
canvas; on the border of the picture he reads: Jhn. Melmoth,
anno 1646. The picture detains him in the closet
a few moments more than necessary, whence his uncle concludes
that he has been examining it. With terrible exertion
he whisperingly communicates to John that the original
of the picture is still alive and that he himself is&mdash;on
that account&mdash;dying of fright. The same night old Melmoth
expires, and John, to his horror, sees the door opened
by a stranger who distinctly resembles the portrait in the
closet.</p>

<p>From the miser’s will it appears that he has made John
his sole heir. He has, moreover, added a memorandum
to the will, in which he enjoins his nephew to destroy the
portrait alluded to, as well as an old manuscript which he
will also find in the closet. John’s curiosity is roused about
the mystery connected with his family, the more so as he
gathers that his uncle has, during his last years, been constantly
hanging over a manuscript which he always concealed
if any one entered the room. From the old Sybil
John learns what tradition has kept alive of the secrets of
the family. She states that the elder brother of the Melmoth
who first settled in Ireland as a follower of Cromwell, was
a great traveller and seldom visited his family; once when
he appeared all were surprised to see that he had undergone
no external change whatever, although he ought to
have been, at that time, a very old man. His visit was but
short, and at his departure he left his portrait behind him.
Some years afterwards a person arrived who appeared to
be most anxious to know as much as possible about Melmoth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
the traveller; but the family being unable&mdash;or unwilling&mdash;to
communicate anything of importance, he departed
and, in his turn, left behind him a manuscript. As to the
traveller, the hag concludes, he is generally believed to be
alive and to make his appearance on the death of such members
of the family as have something weighing upon their
conscience.&mdash;After having burnt the portrait, John devotes
himself to read the old, discoloured, mutilated manuscript
as well as he is able. The writing is interrupted by many
illegible lines; sometimes whole pages are missing. What
he makes out is that the writer, an Englishman called Stanton,
was travelling in Spain in 1676 and there saw a countryman
of his who excited much superstitious horror among
the populace, and, as it seemed, not quite without cause.
Stanton himself had heard him break into a demoniac laughter
on seeing two persons blighted by lightning, and shortly
afterwards heard a story still more terrible. At a fashionable
wedding-feast he had frightened all by the unearthly
glare of his eyes, and even killed a priest who was going
to utter a prayer, by merely staring at him. The wedding
had ended by the bride being found dead in the arms of the
bridegroom, who had lost his reason on the same occasion;
and this tragic event also had been attributed to the machinations
of the stranger&mdash;Melmoth the traveller. Stanton,
tormented by an inexplicable longing to see and hear more
of his mysterious countryman, had returned to England
and spent several years in fruitless attempts to get sight
of him. At length he had met him outside a theatre, and
Melmoth had uttered a horrible prophecy of their meeting
soon again in a madhouse. And he was right; Stanton was
confined at a hospital through the means of a designing
relative, and when the horrors of his situation had well-nigh
spent him, Melmoth had appeared in his cell, spoken
much to him and finally offered to bring about his liberation,
on certain conditions. The pages where these conditions are
expounded are illegible in the manuscript John is examining,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
but it appears that Stanton had rejected them in great rage,
whereupon Melmoth had departed. When Stanton finally
gained his liberty he had resumed his restless pursuit of
Melmoth. He had also visited Ireland, and left there the
manuscript containing a narrative of his adventures.</p>

<p>So the manuscript ends; but John is soon to learn more
of his interesting ancestor. One night, in a violent storm,
a vessel is wrecked and lost on the coast. All the neighbourhood
gather on the shore and, under John’s command, do
their best to save the crew, but their efforts are ineffectual.
In the midst of his toil John perceives a man standing tranquilly
upon a rock somewhat out of the way, and suddenly
a terrible laugh is heard. Remembering the manuscript
John rushes towards him, stumbles on his way and falls
down into the sea. The only one of the shipwrecked who has
succeeded in reaching the coast gets hold of him and clings
to him until both are thrown on the shore by a huge wave.
They are carried up to the manor-house, and after some
days their strength is restored. The stranger is found to
be a Spaniard; his first question is, whether John’s name
is not Melmoth. Receiving an answer in the affirmative he
shows him a portrait, which John instantly recognizes as
a miniature of the one he has destroyed. The Spaniard,
apparently a man who has suffered much, then proceeds
to tell the story of his life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The narrative related above, lengthy as it is, serves as
a sort of introduction to all that follows, affording the first
imperfect glimpses of the Wanderer. The scenes which are
enacted in the dreary, half-decayed country-house before
and after the miser’s death are the best-written passages
in <i>Melmoth</i>, representing, together with certain chapters in
<i>Women</i>, Maturin’s art on its very highest level; and this
art, it is as well to observe, is eminently realistic. Little
as the abode of old Melmoth has in common with the household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
of Mr. Wentworth, there is the same blending of intensely
suggestive ‘atmosphere’ and minute truthfulness to
nature about the descriptions. The sorry state of the manor
to which John Melmoth travels and which recalls his gloomiest
memories, is vividly painted thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As John slowly trod the miry road which had once been the
approach, he could discover, by the dim light of an autumnal evening,
signs of increasing desolation since he had last visited the spot,&mdash;signs
that penury had been aggravated and sharpened into downright
misery. There was not a fence or a hedge round the domain:
an uncemented wall of loose stones, whose numerous gaps were filled
with furze or thorns, supplied their place. There was not a tree
or shrub on the lawn; the lawn itself was turned into pasture-ground,
and a few sheep were picking their scanty food amid the pebble-stones,
thistles, and hard mould, through which a few blades of
grass made their rare and squalid appearance.</p>

<p>The house itself stood strongly defined even amid the darkness
of the evening sky; for there were neither wings, or offices, or
shrubbery, or tree, to shade or support it and soften its harsh outline.
John, after a melancholy gaze at the grass-grown steps and
boarded windows, “addressed himself” to knock at the door; but
knocker there was none: loose stones, however, there were in plenty;
and John was making vigorous application to the door with one of
them, till the furious barking of a mastiff, who threatened at every
bound to break his chain, and whose yell and growl, accompanied
by “eyes that glow and fangs that grin” savoured as much of
hunger as of rage, made the assailant raise the siege on the door,
and betake himself to a well-known passage that led to the kitchen.
A light glimmered in the window as he approached: he raised the
latch with a doubtful hand; but, when he saw the party within, he
advanced with the step of a man no longer doubtful of his welcome.</p>
</div>

<p>The party in question consists of old Melmoth’s servants
and ‘followers.’ This was the last time Maturin depicted
his countrymen, the lower Irish, and never had he done
so with more vigour and penetration. They are described
without even a semblance of idealization; specifically Irish
is only their instinctive deference to persons of higher rank,
and their endless circumlocutions of speech, but there is
no boisterous and overflowing humour about them, still
less a breath of soul-stirring romance; they simply are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
what circumstances have made them, and that is, in this
case at least, a set to be both disliked and distrusted. Yet
the picture does not lack its brighter side. These people
cannot, as a matter of course, be expected to be exactly
sorry at the approaching end of their master, but John Melmoth
has nothing to fear from them, and that there is much
in them that is naturally good and brave is seen in their
spontaneous efforts to save the sinking vessel. There is an
old housekeeper who is described with a kind of rough
sympathy and not without strokes of humour. John has
always been an object of her tenderness&mdash;long ago, when
he was staying in the house and was sent hungry to bed,
she had often stolen up to him with something she had had
much trouble to save, and she still kindly insists on calling
him her ‘whiteheaded boy.’ To be sure, she avails herself
of her knowledge how to get at the store of spirits by a
way unknown to old Melmoth, and so has made ample
preparations for his honour’s wake in good time; but she
is, at the same time, really anxious to think of his soul in
his departing hour, and conceives it to be her religious duty
perforce to put upon him a clean shirt when that solemn
hour draws nigh.&mdash;The old Sybil, on the other hand, is a
decidedly unsympathetic figure, a humbug and an impostor of
the first order, a type not common in the fiction of the time.</p>

<p>Old Melmoth is extremely well drawn; in the few pages
treating of him his character stands perfectly clear before
the reader. Though always of a niggardly turn, he has
once been a gentleman, and has, in fact, never committed
actual wrongs in the course of accumulating his wealth.
‘He was,’ says the housekeeper, ‘of a hard hand, and a hard
heart, but he was as jealous of another’s right as of his
own. He would have starved all the world, but he would
not have wronged it of a farthing.’ He is, towards the end
of his life, tormented by fear as much as by the passion
of avarice. His days are passed in the revolting but irresistible
task of studying the manuscript, and he firmly believes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
that he has seen his mysterious ancestor in his own house.
In the superstitious horror that never leaves him he clings,
as it were, all the more eagerly to something real and concrete,
and, having nought else, he cherishes his worldly
goods until he sits in the kitchen to save a fire in his own
room and expresses, as his last, the desire to be buried in
a parish coffin. A fragment of his conversation best illustrates
the character of old Melmoth:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash;“What made you burn sixes in the kitchen, you extravagant
jade? How many years have you lived in this house?” “I don’t
know, your honour.” “Did you ever see any extravagance or waste
in it?” “Oh never, never, your honour.” “Was any thing but a farthing
candle ever burned in the kitchen?” “Never, never, your
honour.” “Were not you kept as tight as hand and head and heart
could keep you, were you not? answer me that.” “Oh yes, sure,
your honour; every <i>sowl</i> about us knows that,&mdash;every one does
your honour justice, that you kept the closest house and closest
hand in the country,&mdash;your honour was always a good warrant
for it.” “And how dare you unlock my hold before death has unlocked
it,” said the dying miser, shaking his meagre hand at her.
“I smelt meat in the house,&mdash;I heard voices in the house,&mdash;I
heard the key turn in the door over and over. Oh that I was up,”
he added, rolling in impatient agony in his bed, “oh that I was up,
to see the waste and ruin that is going on. But it would kill me,”
he continued, sinking back on the bolster, for he never allowed
himself a pillow; “it would kill me,&mdash;the very thought of it is killing
me now.” The women, discomfited and defeated, after sundry
winks and whispers, were huddling out of the room, till recalled
by the sharp eager tones of old Melmoth.&mdash;“Where are ye trooping
to now? back to the kitchen to gormandize and guzzle? Won’t
one of ye stay and listen while there’s a prayer read for me? Ye
may want it one day for yourselves, ye hags.” Awed by this expostulation
and menace the train silently returned, and placed themselves
round the bed, while the housekeeper, though a Catholic, asked if
his honour would not have a clergyman to give him <i>the rights</i> (rites)
of his church. The eyes of the dying man sparkled with vexation
at the proposal. “What for,&mdash;just to have him expect a scarf and
hat-band at the funeral. Read the prayers yourself, you old &mdash;&mdash;;
that will save something.”&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>With these scenes of strong and sordid realism is mingled
the supernatural fear felt for the traveller; but sparingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
and skilfully as this supernatural element is used, it does
not disturb the general style of the narrative. It only serves
to heighten the gloominess of the atmosphere and to excite
the reader’s curiosity. This curiosity is admirably kept alive
throughout the whole. It increases gradually, being never
satisfied. When John asks the old hag to tell him all she
knows about his ancestor, it is stated that she leaves him
excited with a story, wild, improbable, actually incredible.
The story is not at once related to the reader; he is left in
suspense about it, while John Melmoth immediately proceeds
to gather more information from the manuscript.
It appears, however, that candles there are none in the house,
and until such are procured from a neighbouring village,
he sits alone in the dreary room, while night falls upon him
and the sky is overcast with dark clouds promising a long
continuance of gloom and rain. Now he in his thoughts
recapitulates the story he has just heard, the one with reference
to the traveller and his portrait. The messenger sent
to the village then returning, John seeks out the manuscript
and begins, by the ghastly light of a couple of candles,
to decipher a story much wilder than that which he has
from the hag. It is easy to perceive that the increase of
interest is greater with this succession, than if the calmer
passage about the preparations for studying the manuscript
were placed between the two stories.&mdash;As for the fragmentary
manuscript itself, it of course always breaks off at the
most thrilling moment.</p>

<p>By the opening chapters of <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>, Maturin’s
first romance of <i>Montorio</i> is called to mind in a way
clearly showing the disadvantages of the Radcliffe style
and the general inferiority in the construction of stories of
that school. The figure of Schemoli&mdash;which, as has been
shown, is a typically Radcliffeian hero&mdash;is here, in many
respects, a prototype of Melmoth: the obscurity in which
his person is veiled as well as his sudden and unimpeded
entrances where he is not expected, are traits which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
descended to the Wanderer; but the supernaturalness of
the latter is real and need not be explained as some utterly
incredible, merely human attainments. In one of the half-ruinous
apartments of the castle of Muralto where Annibal
is so fond of rambling, there is an old portrait, the eyes of
which are, by the tricks of Schemoli, made to appear to
him as living. The impression made on John Melmoth by
the portrait in the miser’s secret closet is a result of that
same preternatural quality in the original, which, once
accepted, defies all ‘natural’ elucidations and is not followed
by the disappointment necessarily appertaining to such.
Thus the artistic effect of these scenes is of a permanent
kind and preserves its charm even at re-perusal, which
is never the case with the puerile tricks of the Radcliffe
stories. Yet notwithstanding this slight supernatural import,
the incidents taking place in the house of old Melmoth
cannot be ranked among the actual ‘Gothic’ stories. These
incidents are not fantastical or violent enough, and the style
is too strikingly realistic; nor does the ‘passion of supernatural
fear’ here seem to be the ultimate object of the
author. The tale of Stanton, on the other hand, is typically
a production of the school of terror. To begin with, the
introduction of a story by the discovery of an old, half-moulding
manuscript was a favourite one with most of the
writers of this school, and the manuscript studied by John
Melmoth affords all the usual requisites: Spanish environs,
with ruins both Moorish and Roman, amid thunder and
lightning; wedding-feasts in great houses with dead bride
and insane bridegroom; religious intolerance, Inquisition,
and fear of the devil. These passages are rather rhapsodical&mdash;as
indeed they are meant to be&mdash;and less interesting
than Stanton’s subsequent experiences in England; the madhouse
where Stanton is confined is described more horribly
than any prisons of the Inquisition in any romance of terror.
The time of action is that of Charles II: a period in which
Maturin was deeply versed and which had a strange fascination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
for him. In his pursuit of Melmoth, Stanton is said
often to visit places of public amusement, and it is at a
theatre he at last discovers him. This gives Maturin occasion
to insert a brilliant study of the theatrical performances
of that time, most evidently written <i>con amore</i>, in spite of
the strong emphasis laid upon the loose morals of these
amusements. After one performance, during which a great
commotion is caused by the attempt of an actress to stab
her rival in good earnest, Stanton meets Melmoth in the
deserted street, where he has been waiting for him. Stanton
being, at first, at a loss what to say, Melmoth quietly
announces that they will soon meet again:&mdash;‘the place
shall be the bare walls of a madhouse, where you shall rise
rattling in your chains, and rustling from your straw, to
greet me,&mdash;yet still you shall have the <i>curse of sanity</i>, and
of memory. &mdash; &mdash; <i>I never desert my friends in misfortune.</i>
When they are plunged in the lowest abyss of human calamity,
they are sure to be visited by me.’</p>

<p>Here, for the first time, is given the clue to Melmoth’s
personality and the purpose of his wanderings; from the
tale of Stanton it can also be concluded that Melmoth has
the power of contributing to, as well as predicting, the
destiny of his victims. The prophecy is fulfilled. Stanton’s
eccentric mode of living and incessant talk of Melmoth,
whom nobody else has ever seen, rouses the belief in his
madness. Of this belief his nearest relative and heir, an
unscrupulous man, resolves to avail himself. He procures
a place in a madhouse which he easily induces the careless
and absent-minded Stanton to visit, and there he is forced
to remain. The picture which Maturin draws of this place
is frightful in the extreme, yet doubtless historically true,
in as much as lunatics at that time were treated exactly
like criminals, chains and whip being the only medicine
resorted to by the keepers, many of whom were most inhuman
ruffians. But this picture is also in other respects
pervaded by the spirit of the time. About the Restoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
insanity raged in England more than at any other period
before or since, and the fanaticism, both religious and political,
of the preceding decades, has amply furnished the madhouses
with wretched inmates. As Stanton’s next neighbours
there are a puritan weaver, who has lost his reason
after listening to one of the celebrated preachers of the day,
and a loyalist tailor, who has been ruined by too liberal
a credit to the cavaliers; and these two pass the nights in
desperate controversies which make the very walls ring.
Further, there is a woman who has lost her husband and
all her children in the great London fire&mdash;this, too, a topic
of the day. Once a week, the night of her disaster, she
recapitulates the horrors which have befallen her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The maniac marked the destruction of the spot where she
thought she stood by one desperate bound, accompanied by a wild
shriek, and then calmly gazed on her infants as they rolled over
the scorching fragments, and sunk into the abyss of fire below.
“There they go&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;all!” and her voice sunk
into low mutterings, and her convulsions into faint, cold shudderings,
like the sobbings of a spent storm, as she imagined herself
to “stand in safety and despair,” amid the thousand houseless wretches
assembled in the suburbs of London on the dreadful night after
the fire; without food, roof, or raiment, all gazing on the burning
ruins of their dwellings and their property. She seemed to listen
to their complaints, and even repeated some of them very affectingly,
but invariably answered them with the same words, “But I have
lost all my children&mdash;all!” It was remarkable, that when this
sufferer began to rave, all the others became silent. The cry of
nature hushed every other cry,&mdash;she was the only patient in the
house who was not mad from politics, religion, inebriety, or some
perverted passion; and terrifying as the out-break of her frenzy
always was, Stanton used to await it as a kind of relief from the
dissonant, melancholy, and ludicrous ravings of the others.</p>
</div>

<p>It is clear that Stanton well-nigh loses his own reason
in this neighbourhood. At first he tries to effect his liberation
by observing a calm and sane behaviour, but seeing
that his sanity is interpreted as the refined cunning of a
madman, he gradually gives up all hope. He grows careless
and neglects himself; at last he never rises from his wretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
bed, and when Melmoth, according to his promise, appears
in his cell, he is indeed ‘in the lowest abyss of human calamity.’
To judge from some indistinct lines in the manuscript,
Stanton from the first receives him with distrust; for on
the following pages Melmoth exerts all his terrible eloquence
to induce Stanton to listen to him. He holds out to him the
prospect of his soon losing his reason, or, still more dreadful,
of his fear of losing it becoming a hope&mdash;nay, even to
the life to come Melmoth extends his gloomy anticipations.
He points out that as there is not a crime which madmen
are not prepared to commit, the soul of a madman is not
likely to be favourably judged, but, on the contrary, destroyed
along with the reason, the loss of which, accordingly,
implies the loss of immortality. Thus even his eternal welfare
will depend upon his consenting to be liberated by
Melmoth. The conditions for this are illegible in the manuscript,
but it appears that Stanton indignantly rejects them.
He does not, however, reap very great benefits by his steadfastness,
for, being finally liberated, his life is to pass in the
same restless anxiety as before, and in the same fruitless
efforts to see his tormentor once more.&mdash;</p>

<p>The manuscript being finished the story turns back to
John Melmoth and the shipwrecked Spaniard. The description
of the storm is fine and animated enough, although
this mode of introducing the stranger was none of the newest,
even if somewhat better in its place here than in <i>Bertram</i>.
Here the Spaniard only is saved, and he now becomes the
hero, Melmoth the Wanderer disappearing for a considerable
time. The happenings in the house of old Melmoth, with
the tale of Stanton inserted, form the first great section
of the book, being still of an introductory character. The
general effect is an excellent one. The desolated country-house
is a very appropriate back-ground to the fantastical
incidents read in the ancient manuscript; and different
as are the styles of the two narratives, the contrast is not
inartistic. This introduction to <i>Melmoth</i> is evidently reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
in some fantastic productions of later time. The idea
of the Wanderer’s marvellous portrait has been supposed<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
to reappear in <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1890)&mdash;Wilde,
whose mother was a niece of Maturin, was well acquainted
with his great-uncle’s romance; it will be remembered that
he lived his last years in Paris under the name of Sebastien
Melmoth. In one of the most famous English ghost-stories,
Bulwer-Lytton’s <i>The Haunted and the Haunters</i> (1859), the
mysterious being is first introduced by means of a miniature
portrait, bearing a strange, never-to-be-forgotten expression.
He has much in common with Melmoth the Wanderer. His
existence is prolonged for centuries&mdash;not, indeed, by any
pact with the devil, but by the extremely developed ‘energetic
faculty that we call <i>will</i>.’ He turns up in various countries
and in various guise, arranging, at his departures, a mock
celebration of his own obsequies. He has the same unlimited
knowledge as Melmoth, and it seems to interest him as little;
and though his supernatural life is traced to a scientific
source, it is even hinted that a power like his, however
malignant, cannot injure the good and the brave.</p>

<p>Owing, probably, to the great length and extraordinary
contents of <i>Melmoth</i>, this introduction seems to have been
passed by with but little notice on the part of the critics.
There are some lines on it in a contemporary review,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
interesting in so far as they show that the first chapters,
exaggerated as they were accused of being, were at once
felt to differ from the rest, and have little to do with the
obsolete school of <i>unnatural</i> terrors:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The opening of the book is natural and simple, relating the
dependence of a poor lad, John Melmoth, on an old miser of an
uncle, and his sudden call from college to attend his uncle on his
death-bed. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; We shall not inflict upon our readers the horrors
attending the miser’s death-bed, or the manner in which his neighbours
and servants enjoyed the scene of his departure; though there
are some features of the description very natural, and others, we doubt
not, very national: but then our author never stops in the right
place. Over doing, <i>Anglice</i>, exaggeration, seems a passion with him.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>The ‘natural and simple’ was what people were beginning
to have an appetite for; <i>Melmoth</i>, like <i>Montorio</i>, came into
the world just a little too late to be exactly what the public
wanted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the <i>Tale of the Spaniard</i> the stranger relates to John
Melmoth a part of his life which has been passed amid extraordinary
hardships and sufferings, in desperate attempts
to escape from a convent in Madrid, and subsequently in
the prisons of the Inquisition. He is a descendant of the
ducal house of Monçada; his mother is of a rank far inferior,
and Alonzo (the hero) is born before his parents are united
in marriage, for which reason he is educated in strict seclusion.
The marriage, however, is at last acknowledged by
the old duke, Alonzo’s grandfather, but Alonzo, before his
birth, has already been devoted to God and destined to
become a minister of religion, in expiation of his mother’s
crime. Inspired by her Director she fanatically insists on
Alonzo’s entering a convent of ex-Jesuits, and as this is
much against the inclinations of Alonzo, the contention grows
very acute. Alonzo’s father is good-natured but weak; in
his heart he commiserates his son, but dare not oppose the
menaces of the Director, who urges the fulfilment of the
vow solely to maintain and augment his own power over
the family. To overcome Alonzo’s resistance every means,
fair and foul, are resorted to, and finally a promise is extorted
from him to become a novice. These proceedings it is
of interest to compare to certain chapters in the great Italian
novel <i>I promessi sposi</i> (1827) of Alessandro Manzoni&mdash;namely,
to those in which Gertrude, the daughter also of
a duke, is, likewise for family reasons, forced to take the
veil. There is much resemblance between her fate and
Alonzo’s. From their earliest childhood their future vocation
is spoken of as a thing irrevocably decided, as well as perfectly
agreeable to themselves, and as they grow old enough
to have an opinion of their own, allurement and compulsion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
is alternately used to subdue it; during their noviciate
they are treated with peculiar indulgence on account of
their birth and high connections; and the demoralizing
influence of coersion, which shows itself in a repulsive hypocrisy,
is strongly emphasized in both cases. It would, of
course, be too bold to assert that Manzoni had received
any impulses from <i>Melmoth</i>, although he is known to have
been a student of English literature, especially of Scott;
but the parallel unquestionably goes to show that this part
of <i>Melmoth</i> is not only a work of anti-catholic imagination,
without any relation to real life in Catholic society. The
mild and quiet style of Manzoni is, otherwise, as far as far
can be from the indignant rage that burns in every line of
the Spaniard’s tale. Maturin, as has been said, was convinced
that his own ancestors had been victims of Catholic
intolerance, and his antipathy to the darker sides of this
religion, always keen, is nowhere so strongly expressed as
in the present story. He sees nothing good in monastic
life and refuses to find any redeeming features in a system
which favours it. Young as Alonzo is, he fully comprehends
the hypocrisy practised by the monks and novices, and
immediately conceives an invincible aversion for the convent.
This aversion is, in fact, shared by all its inmates;
but those who themselves have lost all hope of liberation
are, out of envy, most anxious to retain others in the same
misery. Thus a frank, open word is never heard among
them, and when trying to address his comrades, Alonzo is
invariably repelled by the sanctimonious and untruthful
air they assume towards him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I said to them, “Are you, then, intended for the monastic life?”
“We hope so.” “Yet I have heard you, Oliva, <i>once</i> (it was when you
did not think I overheard you) I heard you complain of the length
and tediousness of the homilies delivered on the eves of the saints.”&mdash;“I
was then under the influence of the evil spirit doubtless,” said
Oliva, who was a boy not older than myself. “Satan is sometimes
permitted to buffet those whose vocation is but commencing, and
whom he is therefore more afraid to lose.” “And I have heard you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Balcastro, say you had not taste for music; and to me, I confess,
that of the choir appears least likely to inspire a taste for it.” “God
had touched my heart since,” replied the young hypocrite, crossing
himself; “and you know, friend of my soul, there is a promise, that
the ears of the deaf shall be opened.” “Where are those words?”
“In the Bible.” “The Bible?&mdash;But we are not permitted to read
it.” “True, dear Monçada, but we have the word of our Superior
and the brethren for it, and that is enough.” “Certainly; our spiritual
guides must take on themselves the whole responsibility of
that state, whose enjoyments and punishments they reserve in
their own hands; but, Balcastro, are you willing to take this life
on their word, as well as the next, and resign it before you have tried
it?” “My dear friend, you only speak to tempt me.” “<i>I do not speak
to tempt</i>,” said I, and was turning indignantly away &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>When Alonzo, touched by the grief and despair of his
mother, at last consents to take the vow and finally to
enter the monastery, he is soon to see that hypocrisy is not
the only vice thriving in that fertile soil. The incidents
related above present a subtle and powerful picture of the
influence of the Catholic church, but thus far there has been
nothing actually horrible in the Spaniard’s tale. Now, however,
the story becomes of rather a blood-curdling character.
There is a conversation which Alonzo holds with an old
monk who lies on his death-bed, which deserves to be quoted
at some length, as it strikes the key-note of all the miseries
of monastic life. These were, in Maturin’s opinion, the
inevitable result of an existence stiffening away in brutalizing
monotony, and never yet had he depicted such an existence
in darker colours:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But to me, and to all the community, you seemed to be resigned
to the monastic life.” “I seemed a lie&mdash;I lived a lie&mdash;I was
a lie&mdash;I ask pardon of my last moments for speaking the truth&mdash;I
presume they neither can refuse me, or discredit my words&mdash;I
hated the monastic life. Inflict pain on man, and his energies
are roused&mdash;condemn him to insanity, and he slumbers like animals
that have been found inclosed in wood and stone, torpid and content;
but condemn him at once to pain and insanity, as they do
in convents, and you unite the sufferings of hell and of annihilation.
For sixty years I have cursed my existence. I never woke to hope,
for I had nothing to do or to expect. I never lay down with consolation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
mockeries of God, as exercises of devotion. The moment
life is put beyond the reach of your will, and placed under the influence
of mechanical operations, it becomes, to thinking beings,
a torment insupportable.</p>

<p>“I never ate with appetite, because I knew, that with or without
it, I must go to the refectory when the bell rung. I never lay
down to rest in peace, because I knew the bell was to summon me
in defiance of nature, whether I was disposed to prolong or shorten
my repose. I never prayed, for my prayers were dictated to me.
I never hoped, for my hopes were founded not on the truth of God,
but on the promises and threatenings of man. My salvation hovered
on the breath of a being as weak as myself, whose weakness I was
nevertheless obliged to flatter, and struggle to obtain a gleam of
the grace of God, through the dark distorted medium of the vices
of man. <i>It never reached me</i>&mdash;I die without light, hope, faith, or
consolation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Under circumstances like these the most passionate contentions
are excited by the slightest causes, and the minutest
deviations from regularity are regarded as adventures of
the most important gravity. Yet the liveliness thus aroused
naturally becomes morbid and distorted, and degenerates
into ‘spleen, malignity, curiosity.’ The soul is stunted for
ever, and the mind grows impervious to every great or
generous feeling; barbarous punishments are inflicted for
the slightest offences. Alonzo is, from his very entrance
there, the black sheep of this community. He is, indeed,
most punctual in his religious performances, but it is easy
to see that he is not penetrated with the spirit of the monastical
life, and his exactness in the forms only ‘will not do’
for the monks. They can not excite his interest about such
matters as whether the hour for matins should be postponed
‘full five minutes,’ and even a sham miracle is performed
for his sake in vain. Before long an unexpected incident
gives them opportunity of assuming towards him an attitude
decidedly hostile. One night the porter of the convent
smuggles to Alonzo a scrap of paper, which turns out to be a
letter from his brother Juan, whom he has seen but once and
who is intent upon effecting his liberation from the convent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Juan, the younger son of the duke Monçada, has been
educated by the Director and, from his earliest infancy,
been taught to hate his brother and regard him as a bastard
and usurper of his rights. In this the Director first succeeds,
but then the impetuous and vehement nature which he has
tried to develop in Juan, is suddenly turned against himself.
To the monastical life Juan has an aversion as strong
as that of Alonzo himself, and when he learns that the latter
is to be made a monk, he cannot but think it an injustice,
and begins to feel a strange interest in his unfortunate
brother. It is a fine and touching piece of juvenile psychology
Maturin gives in the short sketch of Juan. A mind
naturally generous, if ever so spoiled and distorted by improper
education, always wishes its enemy to be in a fighting condition;
and when Juan thinks of Alonzo as a monk, an
object unfit for hate and unable to defend himself, his feelings
of hostility are replaced by a passion exactly opposite,
only stronger, as being conformable to his natural instincts.
He now finds out all the wrongs done to Alonzo, and devotes
his energies to his liberation. Alonzo, he learns, can reclaim
his vows, if he declares them to have been extorted
from him by fraud or terror; the business can be carried
on in a civil court. Juan then procures an able advocate
and succeeds in bribing the porter of the convent, through
whom Alonzo is to send him a written memorial to be used
by the advocate.</p>

<p>Having received his brother’s communication Alonzo at
once proceeds to write the memorial, on the pretext of
writing his confessions, and safely dispatches it to Juan.
His frequent demands for paper, however, have excited
the suspicions of the Superior, and Alonzo is accused of
having employed the paper granted to him in some purpose
contrary to the interests of the community. His cell and
his person are searched with a zeal showing that the monks
have, at last, got something to do. Nothing is found, but
a few days later a copy of the memorial is sent by the advocate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
to the Superior. Now Alonzo is subjected to severe
persecution on the part of the community, led by its brutal
Superior. First of all he is confined in a subterranean dungeon,
where he passes three days fighting with reptiles. Then
he is removed to his cell, as the Superior, on account of
the publicity with which the suit is carried on, dare not keep
him actually imprisoned; still the community seems to
have resolved that if he is to quit the convent, he is not
to do so alive. He becomes the object of complete excommunication.
He is excluded from the matins and from
the church in general, and publicly pointed out as an object
of the greatest abhorrence; he is never spoken to, every
one shrinking from him as from a polluted being. At meals
a mat is placed for him in the midst of the hall, where he
is supplied with offal from the kitchen. The crucifix, the
rosary, the vessel for holy water and everything else is
removed from his cell so that at last there is nothing left
except the bare walls and a miserable bed. The worst of
all is that he is denied repose. One night he awakes to see
his cell in flames; hideous figures have been scrawled on
the walls with phosphorus. Another night he is aroused
by a voice whispering to him temptations and blasphemies
until he almost believes he is spoken to by the enemy of
mankind. He cannot suppress a cry of horror; immediately
a monk rushes in asking why he disturbs him in his sleep.
Alonzo alleges turbulent dreams and the monk departs, but
the following night the scenes are renewed. The voice
becomes more and more horrible, uttering things which
a good Catholic would shudder even to think of; once the
image of the mother of God is displayed to him, and the
voice exhorts him to spurn it and to spit upon it. Weak
and delirious though he is, Alonzo still has power to resist
these invitations. He cannot, consequently, be accused of
obeying the temptations of Satan, but the news of his being
subjected to them spread rapidly through the convent.
Everybody believes, or pretends to believe it, and the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
horror towards Alonzo increases; he is now excluded
from all devotions. One night, when the voice again discusses
the Madonna in an unutterable connection, the measure
flows over:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I could bear it no longer. I sprung from my bed, I ran through
the gallery like a maniac, knocking at the doors of the cells, and
exclaiming, “Brother such a one, pray for me,&mdash;pray for me, I
beseech you.” I roused the whole convent. Then I flew down
to the church; it was open, and I rushed in. I ran up the aisle,
I precipitated myself before the altar, I embraced the images, I clang
to the crucifix with loud and reiterated supplications. The monks,
awakened by my outcries, or perhaps on the watch for them, descended
in a body to the church, but, perceiving I was there, they
would not enter,&mdash;they remained at the doors, with lights in their
hands, gazing on me. It was a singular contrast between me, hurrying
round the church almost in the dark (for there were but a few
lamps burning dimly), and the group at the door, whose expression
of horror was strongly marked by the light, which appeared to have
deserted me to concentrate itself among them. The most impartial
person on earth might have supposed me deranged, or possessed,
or both, from the state in which they saw me. Heaven knows, too,
what construction might have been put on my wild actions, which
the surrounding darkness exaggerated and distorted, or on the prayers
which I uttered, as I included in them the horrors of the temptation
against which I implored protection. Exhausted at length,
I fell to the ground, and remained there, without the power of
moving, but able to hear and observe every thing that passed. I
heard them debate whether they should leave me there or not, till
the Superior commanded them to remove that abomination from
the sanctuary; and such was the terror of me into which they had
acted themselves, that he had to repeat his orders before he could
procure obedience to them. They approached me at last, with the
same caution that they would an infected corse, and dragged me
out by the habit, leaving me on the paved floor before the door of
the church. They then retired, and in this state I actually fell
asleep, and continued so till I was awoke by the bell for matins.
I recollected myself, and attempted to rise; but my having slept
on a damp floor, when in a fever from terror and excitement, had
so cramped my limbs, that I could not accomplish this without
the most exquisite pain. As the community passed in to matins,
I could not suppress a few cries of pain. They must have seen what
was the matter, but not one of them offered me assistance, nor did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
I dare to implore it. By slow and painful efforts, I at last reached
my cell; but, shuddering at the sight of the bed, I threw myself
on the floor for repose.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>With these procedures, however, the monks at last overshoot
the mark. A closed community as the convent is,
still the rumour is spread in Madrid, that a monk there is
every night sorely harassed by the devil. This rumour
also attracts the attention of the authorities, and the bishop
of the diocese arrives to investigate the matter. He is a
man calm, rigid, and passionless beyond measure, nor does
he feel any personal sympathies for Alonzo; but when he
sees the state of Alonzo’s cell and hears of the treatment he
has been subjected to&mdash;which is contrary to the established
rules of the convent&mdash;he sternly commands the Superior
to restore everything to Alonzo and make him no longer
an exception in any respect. Thus far, then, his torments
now come to an end, but the greatest blow is yet to fall:
intelligence reaches the convent of the failure of his appeal.</p>

<p>Day follows day without Alonzo’s heeding them, until
a new adventure commences, more dreadful than all the
previous, as Juan once more finds means of smuggling
a letter to him. He has been kept in the country almost
a prisoner, but has succeeded in escaping to Madrid and
settling everything for the escape of Alonzo, which is to be
accomplished with the help of one of the monks. This
future companion of Alonzo is not an agreeable character;
he has entered the convent in order to escape the punishment
following parricide, and is a man who ‘envies Judas
the thirty pieces of silver for which the Redeemer of mankind
was sold.’ For money he has now undertaken to assist
in the liberation of Alonzo. In spite of Juan’s encouragements,
Alonzo feels despondent and disconsolate. He fully
understands the difficulties of his enterprise; even if he
should manage to quit the convent in safety, where could
a runaway Spanish monk find refuge? Nevertheless he gets
into contact with the monk, who soon fixes the night for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
their escapade. He has procured the key of a door leading
to the vaults of the convent, which have long been disused.
From the vaults there is a trap-door to a remote part of
the garden, whence they are to climb the wall by a ladder
procured by Juan. Before they start it strikes Alonzo that
his companion cannot brave that risk merely on his account,
and asks how he is, in future, to provide for his own safety.
The answer has a peculiarity of its own, opening a prospect
the like of which none of the ‘terrific’ writers before Maturin
had invented:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No, we must escape together. Could you suppose I would
have so much anxiety about an event, in which I had no part but
that of an assistant? It was of my own danger I was thinking,&mdash;it
was of my own safety I was doubtful. Our situation has happened
to unite very opposite characters in the same adventure, but it is
an union inevitable and <i>inseparable</i>. Your destiny is now bound
to mine by a tie which no human force can break,&mdash;we part no
more for ever. The secret that each is in possession of, must be
watched by the other. Our lives are in each other’s hands, and a
moment of absence might be that of treachery. We must pass life
in each watching every breath the other draws, every glance the
other gives,&mdash;in dreading sleep as an involuntary betrayer, and
watching the broken murmurs of each other’s restless dreams. We
may hate each other, (for hatred itself would be a relief, compared
to the tedium of our inseparability), but separate we must never.”</p>
</div>

<p>With these bright prospects the pair commence their
nocturnal wandering in the subterranean vaults, one, no
doubt, of the most frightful wanderings ever described in
literature. All difficulties which possibly can be encountered
in such enterprises are heaped upon them, from their first
ineffectual attempts to force the door with the rusty key
and with lacerated hands, till the moment they sink down,
exhausted, at the trap-door, after losing their way, after
seeing their lamps go out, and after stumbling all night
in darkness amid terrors real and imaginary, physical and
psychical. Alonzo remembers old superstitious tales of demons
who seduce monks into the vaults of the convent,
and almost fancies he can hear the choir of their infernal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
sabbath; he grows giddy and stupefied, his knees and
hands are stript of skin, and an intolerable thirst is produced
by the unnatural atmosphere. At last human nature can
endure no more; they lay down ‘like two panting dogs’
in the darkness. When day draws nigh, a faint stream of
light makes itself observable above their heads: they have
arrived just at the trap-door they have been searching for.
But even this hope is turned to despair when it appears
that morning is so far advanced that people are already
in the garden. They have to remain another twenty-four
hours where they are. Retiring into a recess which the
parricide seems to be acquainted with they fall asleep, but
Alonzo is soon roused by the most hideous screams and
imprecations which the other is uttering in his sleep. At
last it becomes too much for Alonzo; he awakens his companion
with great exertions and wildly vows he is not to
sleep any more. The man obeys, but insists on telling
a story which has reference to the very recess they are in
and which proves to be as sinister as were his dreams.</p>

<p>When the parricide was admitted into the convent, he
was appointed to be the executioner whenever a severe
punishment was to be inflicted. This he accepted with
delight; while hating, by nature, every human being and
especially those who seemed happier than himself, he found
his sole satisfaction in making others miserable. Opportunities
were seldom lacking, and to the <i>métier</i> of executioner
he united that of a spy. Once he was desired to keep an
eye upon a young monk whose family had placed him in
the convent in order to prevent him from marrying a woman
of inferior rank. There was, in the air of that monk, something
peculiarly hopeful which naturally excited suspicion.
Shortly afterwards a young novice entered the community,
and the monk and he immediately became inseparable.
‘They were for ever in the garden together&mdash;they inhaled
the odours of the flowers&mdash;they cultivated the same cluster
of carnations&mdash;they entwined themselves as they walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
together&mdash;when they were in the choir, their voices were
like mixed incense.’ The greater their happiness appeared,
the more uneasiness they gave the spy, who was on his
watch night and day. Little by little he drew the certain
conclusion that the novice was a female, and one night, to
his inexpressible joy, he perceived the novice vanish in the
monk’s cell. He secured the door and rushed to his master;
they broke into the cell and the Superior saw what he had
never even thought of and never could understand. His rage
was immense, and the punishment, in the invention of which
the spy had his ample share, was to be worthy of the crime.
The pair were conducted, under the delusion of effecting
their escape, to the place where Alonzo is sitting now, and
allured into a neighbouring recess which they never quitted
alive. The spy kept watch at the door and gradually heard
their love turn to hatred in the agonies of death. On the
sixth day, when all was silent within, the door was unnailed;
the spy now, for the first time, distinctly saw the features
of the novice, and recognized those of his only sister.</p>

<p>This is the story which the parricide relates to Alonzo,
sparing no details. In the meantime evening comes, and
they venture to ascend through the trap-door, and breathe
once more the air of heaven. They hurry through the garden
and climb the wall. Already Alonzo feels himself supported
by the arms of his brother and even enters the carriage
which is waiting for them, when Juan is stabbed from
behind and falls, bathing in his blood. Alonzo falls on his
dead body, losing consciousness; when it returns after a long
time, he finds himself in the prison of the Inquisition.&mdash;</p>

<p>The episode of the lovers who are immured alive was,
of all the stories contained in <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>, the one
which was most disapproved and which attracted the severest
censure. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> while regretting Maturin’s
taste for horrible and revolting subjects, adds: ‘We
thought we had supped full of this commodity; but it seems
as if the most ghastly and disgusting portion of the meal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
was reserved for the present day, and its most hideous concoction
for the writer before us,&mdash;who is never so much
in his favourite element as when he can ‘on horror’s head
horrors accumulate.’ Another critic<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> says, with reference
to the parricide’s conversation: ‘It is no apology for this
to say that it is the language of an atrocious villain&mdash;at
war with society&mdash;steeped to the lips in crime&mdash;upon
whose brow parricide is branded, and who, with a most
profane license, is described by the author to be “<i>beyond
the redemption of a Saviour</i>!” Personages should not be
created by a novelist, whose deeds to be characteristic must
be criminal, and whose phrase to be consistent must be
blasphemous.’ It is not to be wondered at that the reviewers
were shocked; the parricide is the most atrocious of all
the characters of Maturin and death by starvation certainly
a disgusting subject. Yet in their indignation they failed
to notice the extraordinary skill and power displayed in
this episode. Later it has been very differently judged, and,
in fact, remained one of the best-known passages in the book.
In the opinion of Planche<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> the death-scenes of the lovers
form the most beautiful pages in <i>Melmoth</i>; and a modern
writer<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> also declares the episode in question to stand artistically
on a very high level and to show, in the conception
of cruelty, a refinement surpassing even Poe’s in his tale
of <i>The Cask of Amontillado</i>, which it slightly recalls in the
almost scientific exactness with which the sensations of the
victims are observed. The parricide gives this characteristic
reason for his voluntary watch at the prison-door: ‘You
will call this cruelty, I call it curiosity,&mdash;that curiosity
that brings thousands to witness a tragedy, and makes
the most delicate female feast on groans and agonies;’ and
what interests him most is the moment when their love,
annihilated by the pangs of hunger, gives way to hostility
and rage. The man, he remarks, often accuses the woman
as the cause of his sufferings, while she never utters a word
which might pain or wound him: we see that the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
opinion which Maturin entertained of feminine character
asserts itself even in this gloomy instance. The episode of
the lovers seems, upon the whole, to be but little influenced
by any previous writers. Only the detail of the novice
being recognized as the parricide’s sister is borrowed from
the older school of terror, where the destroying of near relations
was well-nigh indispensable.</p>

<p>The continuation of the Spaniard’s tale, on the other
hand, is more closely modelled on patterns easily discernible,
and does not quite come up to the beginning. When Alonzo
has regained some strength he is, in his new prison, visited
by his former companion the parricide, who informs him
that he had stabbed Juan, which it was his business to do,
the whole escape being a comedy, undertaken with the
consent of the Superior, who wished to get rid of Alonzo
by plunging him into a worse place; the parricide, for his
part, has become a spy and a creature of the Holy Office.
Things being now as bad as they can be, it is, at last, time
for Melmoth the Wanderer to interfere. Between his examinations
Alonzo is, every night, visited by a stranger
who gives himself out as a fellow-prisoner and entertains
Alonzo with discussions on various topics. There is, however,
something strangely suspicious in his behaviour, and
Alonzo is frightened by the unearthly lustre of his eyes.
The suspicions of Alonzo gain strength when he is warned
by one of the officials to be on his guard against a person
who has been frequenting some of the cells and set at defiance
all the vigilance of the Inquisition. He makes a candid
confession of the visits of the stranger, hoping by this means
to make a favourable impression upon his judges, but in
this he is totally disappointed. A prisoner whom the devil
is supposed to be so obstinate in visiting, can expect no
mercy from the tribunal. Before Alonzo’s last examination
Melmoth then discloses to him the ‘unutterable condition’
upon which his liberation might be expected. Alonzo never
thinks of accepting it, and hastens to make a full confession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
to a priest, but his doom is sealed: he is sentenced to be
burnt in an autodafé. When the sentence is announced he
sees Melmoth sitting at one of the tables as secretary, and
feels sure that he has been made the dupe of the inquisitorial
officials.</p>

<p>On the morning on which the ceremony is to take place
a fire breaks out within the walls of the Inquisition. Availing
himself of the confusion Alonzo rushes out and finds
his way to a narrow apartment in the end of a street. The
apartment appears to belong to a Jew, known in Madrid
as a good Catholic, but secretly clinging to the religion of
his fathers. He is terrified almost to death at the sudden
entrance of Alonzo&mdash;being just engaged in the initiation
of a young son of his according to the Jewish rites&mdash;but
they soon come to an understanding, and Alonzo remains
in the house. The Jew subsequently finds out that Alonzo
is generally believed to have perished in the fire. This piece
of news, however, makes him incautious, and one day,
during the absence of the Jew, he places himself in the window
to watch a great religious procession. Among the participants
he sees his former companion from the convent;
at the moment he arrives beneath the window he is pointed
out by some one as a parricide and a criminal of the blackest
dye; the fury of the populace is roused, and the man is,
after a fierce struggle, torn to pieces before Alonzo’s eyes.
Alonzo stands riveted to the spot until the horrid spectacle
is over; but the same night the house is searched through
by the inquisitorial officials, who maintain that the soul
of a deceased heretic has been seen hovering near it. The
Jew has just time to conceal Alonzo under one of the boards
of the floor, where a cavity of some dimensions seems to
have been made for the purpose. While the Jew is invoking
all the prophets, Alonzo plunges deeper in the recess and
perceives a kind of passage running out from it. The passage
ends in a room whither he is guided by a faint stream of
light. In the room he finds a very old man, sitting at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
table covered with books and globes and surrounded by
skeletons and scientific instruments. Superstitious and inexperienced
as he is, Alonzo takes him for an evil spirit, but
is reassured by a certain calm dignity in the old man’s manner.
He is, indeed, a Jewish sage who has passed nearly
a life-time in the subterraneous community. He has even
been expecting Alonzo, having learned the secret of his
existence from the other Jew and having requested Alonzo
to be sent to him to act as his ‘secretary.’ He places before
Alonzo a manuscript, written in Spanish with Greek characters,
which he is to copy out. During the interview Alonzo
happens to mention that he has been tempted by an agent
of the enemy, and stood firm. This agent the Jew rightly
concludes to be Melmoth the Wanderer with whom, he hints,
he has been acquainted in his youth, much to his misfortune.
And the manuscript which he has compiled turns out to be
a record of the achievements of Melmoth, of which a new
one now succeeds the <i>Tale of the Spaniard</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That the story of Alonzo di Monçada is a Gothic Romance
of the first magnitude, has never been denied except by
its author. In the preface to <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> Maturin
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Spaniard’s Tale” has been censured by a friend to whom
I read it, as containing too much attempt at the revivification of
the horrors of Radcliffe-Romance, of the persecutions of convents,
and the terrors of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>I defended myself, by trying to point out to my friend, that
I had made the misery of conventual life depend less on the startling
adventures one meets with in romances, than on that irritating
series of petty torments which constitutes the misery of life in general,
and which, amid the tideless stagnation of monastic existence, solitude
gives its inmates leisure to invent, and power combined with
malignity, the full disposition to practise. I trust this defence will
operate more on the conviction of the Reader, than it did on that
of my friend.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, there are probably not many readers on whose
conviction this defence has operated, and who have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
felt that Maturin’s distinctions, as a contemporary critic<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
put it, ‘between his own convents and those of old are rather
fanciful than real.’ The defence can, at the utmost, be
applied to the first part of Alonzo’s stay in the convent,
although even there we find, among the ‘petty torments,’
instances of monks being flogged to death; and it must also
be admitted that this part is the most original. According as
the torments grow decidedly serious, the points of contact
with Godwin and Lewis become more conspicuous. As for
the latter part of the story, it is unquestionably a perfect
‘romance of horror,’ with the horrors introduced solely for
their own sake, only so much more powerful in execution
than its forerunners, that one might be tempted to think
it was Maturin’s wish to show how such a book ought to
be written. In the art of suggestion, so important in tales
of this character, Maturin here, as in <i>Montorio</i>, stands between
Mrs. Radcliffe and Lewis, avoiding the excesses of
both. His grasp on the subject-matter is always stronger
than that of Mrs. Radcliffe, whose gentleness sometimes
reduces her work to ‘a timid trifling with the world of phantoms
and nameless terrors;’<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> while he seldom or never
copies the coarseness of Lewis who, in fact, knows nothing
of the art in question. This is particularly noticeable in
Maturin’s treatment of the (very limited) supernatural element
in <i>Melmoth</i>. He tells, no doubt, many frightful things
and calls them by their names, but then there are also
a great many circumstances which are said to be too horrible
and unhallowed to relate. With sure artistic instinct Maturin
forbears ever to expound the ‘incommunicable condition’
of Melmoth, whereas the surrender of their souls to the devil,
made by Ambrosio and Matilda in <i>The Monk</i>, is laid down
with a clearness and accuracy leaving nothing to be guessed.
Another detail worthy of notice is the circumstance that
the partly supernatural personality of the Wanderer makes
an indelible impression upon those coming into contact
with him, and marks them for life. Stanton, it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
remembered, knows no rest after having encountered Melmoth;
his remaining days are spent in an indefatigable
pursuit of him, the cause of which he could not even explain
to himself; and a similar wish, it must be presumed, eventually
drives Monçada to Ireland. Here may, indeed, be an
influence from Mrs. Shelley’s <i>Frankenstein</i> (1818), where the
hero, in never-allayed anxiety, pursues the monster which
he has created from one end of the world to the other, in
order to prevent him from doing more mischief&mdash;: the
artistic effect is, at all events, incomparably greater than
that attained in <i>The Monk</i>, where the ghosts and spooks
are treated with ease and familiarity, and where a Spanish
nobleman relates that he has encountered the Wandering
Jew, with a burning cross on his forehead, almost as nonchalantly
as he would tell that he has met his brother. With
this general difference in style and execution, many external
motives from <i>The Monk</i> are utilized in the Spaniard’s tale,
as they were in <i>Montorio</i>. The most conspicuous here, again,
is the introduction of ecclesiastical cruelty and monastical
oppression; the case of Ildefonsa in <i>Montorio</i> which, as we
have seen, was suggested by the story of Agnes de Medina
in <i>The Monk</i>, is here applied to Alonzo, with a power leaving
both those romances far behind. The Domina of Lewis
and the Superior of Maturin represent the same type: both
are narrow-minded, hypocritical and revengeful, and pride
themselves on the strict order and discipline maintained in
their convents. Both are, on important occasions, surrounded
by four satellites, who obey their every sign, and
who are employed to drag recalcitrant monks and nuns to
the subterranean dungeons, which, in both tales, are swarming
with nauseous reptiles. A reminiscence of very unpleasant
character, from Lewis, is also the dismal end of
the parricide; in <i>The Monk</i> the same fate overtakes the
Domina, when her cruelty to the young nun becomes known.
She, too, is about to take part in a religious procession,
when suddenly she is made an object of the rage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
people. As in the case of the parricide, neither the solemnity
of the occasion, nor the respect for the priests present, nor
fear of the soldiers can protect the victim from the populace,
which presses on like a storm and never rests until
its vengeance is fulfilled. In <i>The Monk</i> the Domina tries
to make some sort of resistance, but ‘at length a flint, aimed
by some well-directing hand, struck her full upon the temple.
She sank upon the ground bathed in blood, and in a few minutes
terminated her miserable existence;’ Maturin tells
that the man does not cease to howl for mercy ‘till a stone,
aimed by some pitying hand, struck him down. He fell,
trodden in one moment into sanguine and discoloured mud
by a thousand feet.’ It is but just to Mrs. Radcliffe to
observe that she never would have described scenes like
these.</p>

<p>The latter part of the story, containing the scenes in and
after the Inquisition, is clearly influenced by Godwin. Of
the examinations and official proceedings very little is told.
Monçada, like St. Leon, is bound by an oath which he considers
sacred, not to reveal what takes place under the roof
of the Holy Office&mdash;an oath rather convenient to the author.
St. Leon is, in his cell, visited by a creature of the Inquisition&mdash;a
similar figure appears in <i>The Italian</i> of Mrs. Radcliffe&mdash;who
tries to ensnare him in his own answers, the like
of whom Alonzo supposes Melmoth to be. Both are finally
condemned to flames, from which they escape in manners
so closely alike, that the incident itself must be considered
one of Maturing most obvious borrowings, although his
execution, here again, is so much superior to his model,
that it well-nigh recalls Shakespeare’s way of treating his
‘loans.’ When St. Leon is marching in the procession of
the autodafé, some confusion arises from a horse rearing
violently. This irritates the other horses, and the bustle
becomes such that St. Leon succeeds in absconding and,
like Alonzo, rushes down a narrow lane. All this is told
in a few lines. In Melmoth the confusion is caused by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
fire&mdash;an expedient less original but more acceptable&mdash;of
which there is a description long and truly magnificent.
In the end of the lane St. Leon, like Alonzo, forces his entrance
into the habitation of a Jew, whom he terrifies to
become his involuntary host and concealer. But while there
are, in Godwin, no very interesting <i>intérieurs</i> from the Jewish
community, the corresponding passages in <i>Melmoth</i>, though
fantastic, are depicted with a lively minuteness, and the
sudden appearance of Alonzo even with humour, of which
refreshing quality there is but this short flash in the Spaniard’s
tale. The Jew, it has been mentioned, is on the point
of converting his son, who has been brought up a Catholic,
all implements being ready and the cock to be sacrificed
on the occasion fastened at the leg of a table:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was something at once fearful and ludicrous in the scene
that followed. Rebekah, an old Jewish woman, came at his call;
but, seeing a third person, retreated in terror, while her master, in
his confusion, called her in vain by her <i>Christian</i> name of Maria.
Obliged to remove the table alone, he overthrew it, and broke the
leg of the unfortunate animal fastened to it, who, not to be without
his share in the tumult, uttered the most shrill and intolerable
screams, while the Jew, snatching up the sacrificial knife, repeated
eagerly, “Statim mactat gallum,” put the wretched bird out of its
pain; then, trembling at this open avowal of his Judaism, he sat
down amid the ruins of the overthrown table, the fragments of the
broken vessels, and the remains of the martyred cock. He gazed
at me with a look of stupified and ludicrous inanity, and demanded
in delirious tones, what “my lords the Inquisitors had pleased to
visit his humble but highly-honoured mansion for?” I was scarce
less deranged than he was; and, though we both spoke the same
language, and were forced by circumstances into the same strange
and desperate confidence with each other, we really needed, for the
first half-hour, a rational interpreter of our exclamations, starts
of fear, and bursts of disclosure. At last our mutual terror acted
honestly between us, and we understood each other.</p>
</div>

<p>The description of the subterranean abode is still more
successful and entirely Maturin’s own. The old sage is indeed
like a ghost of the past, where he sits among dusty manuscripts
and the skeletons of his family, deceased a generation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
ago; and the atmosphere in which the new tale commence
is extremely suggestive:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was a night of storms in the world above us; and, far
below the surface of the earth as we were, the murmur of the
winds, sighing through the passages, came on my ear like the
voices of the departed,&mdash;like the pleadings of the dead. Involuntarily
I fixed my eye on the manuscript I was to copy, and
never withdrew till I had finished its extraordinary contents.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Even the person and character of the Wanderer, such
as he appears in this tale, is less original than elsewhere in
the book. His discussions in Alonzo’s cell, which are rather
overloaded with historical information, may have been suggested
by a passage in <i>The Monk</i>, where it is said of the
Wandering Jew, that ‘he named people who had ceased to
exist for many centuries and yet with whom he appeared
to have been personally acquainted.’ Alonzo is struck by
the same peculiarity in Melmoth, who relates anecdotes
which happened during the reign of monarchs belonging to
by-gone ages: ‘These circumstances were trifling, and might
be told by any one, but there was a minuteness and circumstantiality
in his details, that perpetually forced on the
mind the idea that he had himself seen what he described,
and been conversant with the personages he spoke of.’ To
the reader, unfortunately, some of these anecdotes appear
not only trifling but ridiculous, and the mysterious grandeur
in which Melmoth ought to be veiled, is here not quite
successfully sustained. His rôle during the fire is more
impressive, and presents a parallel to the apparition seen
by John Melmoth the night when the Spanish vessel is
wrecked:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At this moment, while standing amid the groupe of prisoners,
my eyes were struck by an extraordinary spectacle. Perhaps it is
amid the moments of despair, that imagination has most power,
and they who have suffered, can best describe and feel. In the burning
light, the steeple of the Dominican church was as visible as at
noon-day. It was close to the prison of the Inquisition. The night
was intensely dark, but so strong was the light of the conflagration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
that I could see the spire blazing, from the reflected lustre, like
a meteor. The hands of the clock were as visible as if a torch was
held before them; and this calm and silent progress of time, amid
the tumultuous confusion of midnight horrors,&mdash;this scene of the
physical and mental world in an agony of fruitless and incessant
motion, might have suggested a profound and singular image, had
not my whole attention been rivetted to a human figure placed
on a pinnacle of the spire, and surveying the scene in perfect tranquillity.
It was a figure not to be mistaken&mdash;it was the figure
of him who had visited me in the cells of the Inquisition.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>A perfect ‘Gothic Romance’ as the Spaniard’s tale is
in form, it is, fundamentally, a treatise against the omnipotence
of the Catholic church, from which omnipotence all
the evils and miseries directly arise. It is a protest against
‘a power whose influence is unlimited, indefinable, and unknown,
even to those who exercise it, as there are mansions
so vast, that their inmates, to their last hour, have never
visited all the apartments;&mdash;a power whose operation is
like its motto,&mdash;one and indivisible’&mdash;as it is a defence
of another philosophy which values freedom, enjoyment of
existence and natural affection. In this fight between theories
the development of characters is, perhaps necessarily,
neglected. Alonzo is but a vehicle by which the author
gives vent to his own views; in himself he is impossible.
It has already been pointed out that all the heroes of Maturin
are very young, but the youth of Alonzo is a downright
absurdity: he is not thirteen when his combat against
monasticism commences; and even a precocious Spaniard
could hardly, at that age, have conceived the idea of an
improved Catholicism which he outlines on several occasions.
For in all his vicissitudes he never ceases to be a good
and sincere Catholic; it is not the religion, but its abuses,
which Maturin&mdash;somewhat <i>post festum</i>, in 1820&mdash;is castigating.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The manuscript read by Monçada in the vault of the Jew
commences with a narrative called the <i>Tale of the Indians</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
In this tale&mdash;and only here&mdash;the Wanderer is the real
hero and it is, so far, the central and most important part
of the book. It has also been the most generally appreciated
of all the tales in <i>Melmoth</i> and contains, indeed, passages
of exquisite beauty, although as a composition it is broken
and somewhat irregular. By way of contrast it is cleverly
placed immediately after the Spaniard’s tale; the scene of
action is removed from subterranean recesses and noxious
vapours far away amid flowers and sunshine.</p>

<p>A small island in the Indian sea, where there has formerly
stood a temple erected to the terrible goddess Seeva,
has, after a series of earthquakes, become depopulated and
totally deserted by the inhabitants of the mainland. Yet
after some time it again has obtained the reputation of
being the seat of a goddess, of an unknown and gentler
character. Rumours of a vision seen there, lovely beyond
description, spread among the natives, and young people
get into the habit of offering fruits and flowers to the new
goddess, who is supposed to be particularly well-disposed
towards lovers. And inhabited the island really is. A small
child, a girl, the sole survivor of the wreck of a Spanish
vessel, has found refuge there and grows up a wild daughter
of nature, as innocent as she is beautiful, as good as she
is lovely. The flowers and birds are her friends; the shells
are her toys; and the sense of fear is utterly unknown
to her, there being nothing in her island which bears a hostile
appearance. Until the great catastrophe there is not
a cloud to disturb her paradisiacal existence. The catastrophe
arrives in the person of Melmoth the Wanderer, who
once chances to visit the deserted island and there finds
Immalee&mdash;this is the name the natives have given their
goddess. The few reminiscences of the Spanish language
which she still retains are revived and developed in her
intercourse with him, while her sentiments towards her
visitor, at the same time, grow to an ardent attachment.
When aware of this, Melmoth, with a generosity that does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
honour to an agent of the enemy, tears himself away and
never revisits the island, nor do they meet again until Immalee
has been discovered and taken back to her family
in Spain.&mdash;</p>

<p>The idea of making the fanciful Indians worship Immalee
as a deity was poetical enough, and it is finely told how
two young lovers, who separately set out to the island with
their offerings, find each other in the presence of the goddess,
and return, happy, in the same canoe. The two are so
fortunate as to get a sight of the mystical being:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The form was that of a female, but such as they had never
before beheld, for her skin was perfectly white, (at least in their
eyes, who had never seen any but the dark-red tint of the natives
of the Bengalese islands). Her drapery (as well as they could see)
consisted only of flowers, whose rich colours and fantastic grouping
harmonized well with the peacock’s feathers twined among them,
and altogether composed a feathery fan of wild drapery, which,
in truth, beseemed an “island goddess.” Her long hair, of a colour
they had never beheld before, pale auburn, flowed to her feet, and
was fantastically entwined with the flowers and the feathers that
formed her dress. On her head was a coronal of shells, of hue and
lustre unknown except in the Indian seas&mdash;the purple and the
green vied with the amethyst, and the emerald. On her white bare
shoulder a loxia was perched, and round her neck was hung a string
of their pearl-like eggs, so pure and pellucid, that the first sovereign
in Europe might have exchanged his richest necklace of pearls for
them. Her arms and feet were perfectly bare, and her step had
a goddess-like rapidity and lightness, that affected the imagination
of the Indians as much as the extraordinary colour of her skin and
hair. The young lovers sunk in awe before this vision as it passed
before their eyes. While they prostrated themselves, a delicious
sound trembled on their ears. The beautiful vision spoke to them,
but it was in a language they did not understand; and this confirming
their belief that it was the language of the gods, they prostrated
themselves to her again.</p>
</div>

<p>This same idea, however, gave rise to some other passages
which sadly jar against the idyllic tone, besides being
very unnecessary. The worship of Immalee, it is told, is
chiefly practised by the younger generation, by whom the
ferocious rites of the old religion are, accordingly, forgotten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
which circumstance does not fail to excite much anger and
disapproval among the old devotees, who are aroused to
opposition against the new order of things. This it would
have been quite sufficient briefly to state; but the fact
that there exist, or have existed, revolting and inhuman
forms of religious exercise, seems to have been a cancer
constantly preying on Maturin’s mind, nor could he ever
say enough on the subject. The satire levelled in <i>Women</i>
at the rigid and bigoted Calvinism was, no doubt, well in
its place, and the indignation with which monasticism and
Inquisition are treated in the present work, can yet be understood;
but the idea of pursuing, with bitter irony, the old
Indian religion prescribing lacerations and human sacrifices,
the loathsome character of which nobody would have dreamt
of defending, is nothing short of ridiculous. The Indian
idyll, beautiful as it is, might have afforded some surprise
to those acquainted with Maturin’s views in general. The
never-ending conflict between the fantastical novelist and
the clergyman of the established church asserts itself very
curiously in the whole conception of Immalee and her life
in the island. Maturin had, more than once, strongly expressed
his opinion, that a mode of life away from the benefits
of civilization cannot but have a brutalizing effect upon
human nature; in one of his sermons there is the following
passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let us ask ourselves what is human life? The question, my
brethren, is of some importance&mdash;we must view man under three
characters&mdash;as a savage&mdash;as a being whose <i>intellectual</i> faculties
are cultivated&mdash;and lastly as acquainted with the blessedness of
religion. What happiness do the former class know? The happiness
of brutality&mdash;horrible felicity! if it be felicity&mdash;the happiness
that may be shared with brutes: though some writers even of this
age have struggled hard to prove that this is the best state of man.
I would not notice them from this place but to notice the monstrous
falsehood, which lies against God, and nature, and truth. The life
of a brute was never intended to be the life of man. Yet there are
writers, and some of those whom I address are acquainted with
those writers, who would teach us that man in his natural state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
is most perfect, and that the heir of immortality is formed not to
be above the beasts that perish.</p>
</div>

<p>Shortly after delivering this (not very brilliant) effusion,
Maturin was himself one of ‘those writers.’ It is true that
the story of Immalee is a work of pure imagination and
that he does not exactly try to prove anything by it or to
lay the case down as a doctrine; but all the same the fact
remains that here a being, while living far from civilization
and in absolute ignorance of religion, is represented as angelically
good and deliciously happy, and that, after her entrance
into a society where religion, may be in a corrupted
form, pervades life in all its phases, she becomes most
wretchedly miserable. Maturin, like most imaginative writers
of the time, could not help once, at least, paying his
tribute to the great ideal of a return to nature, so vigorously
and eloquently put forth in the latter part of the previous
century. Who the writers alluded to are it is, of course,
not difficult to point out. Immalee’s spiritual parent is
Rousseau, through the mediation of Bernardin de St. Pierre;
she is a belated sister of Virginie who, before her, played
with birds and flowers in exotic, Indian surroundings,
depicted in glowing colours. Yet there can be no question
of direct imitation. Immalee is original and romantic, she
belongs as distinctly to the 19:th century as her prototype
does to the 18:th. Maturin, as was his wont, made the case an
extreme one; his heroine lives wholly by herself, taught and
nurtured by nature alone, without a parent or philosopher to
point out to her the benefits of such an education. And the
character of Immalee, in all its fantasticalness, has infinitely
more of ‘nature’ in it than there is in the tedious conventionalism
of Virginie; nor is, after all, the one impossibility more
improbable than the other. As Maturin did not create Immalee
to advocate any theories, he was freer to endow her
with those qualities that spring from <i>das ewig weibliche</i>. Her
first encounter with the Wanderer&mdash;which takes place in
the year of grace 1680&mdash;is most charmingly described:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The stranger approached, and the beautiful vision approached
also, but not like an European female with low and graceful bendings,
still less like an Indian girl with her low salams, but like a young
fawn, all animation, timidity, confidence, and cowardice, expressed
in almost a single action. She sprung from the sands&mdash;ran to her
favourite tree;&mdash;returned again with her guard of peacocks, who
expanded their superb trains with a kind of instinctive motion, as
if they felt the danger that menaced their protectress, and clapping
her hands with exultation, seemed to invite them to share in the
delight she felt in gazing at the <i>new flower that had grown in the sand</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>With true feminine talkativeness she at once begins, in
her imperfect language, to tell her visitor of her solitary
life, her companions, and her innocent amusements. She
tells that she is older than the moon, and never changes,
although the roses fade; that she has often tried in vain
to catch stars and moonbeams, and that she has a friend
whose face meets hers in the stream when the sky is clear.</p>

<p>On this <i>tabula rasa</i>, then, is Melmoth to impress his peculiar
views of the world and its conditions. It is stated that
he regards her with compassion, which feeling he experiences
for the first time in his life. His soul becomes the prey
of contending passions, in the course of which is displayed
what a critic<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> finely terms as ‘the naturalness and supernaturalness
of it, the repulsion and attraction of it, the
sublimity and devilry of it&mdash;not obviously balanced each
to enhance each other, but as it were <i>fused</i> in the white heat
of Maturin’s imagination;’ and as his human nature finally
carries off the victory, the conviction is brought home to
the reader that Melmoth himself deserves something of the
compassion he bestows on Immalee. At first, indeed, he
appears as a tempter, endeavouring to corrupt her mind
and, above all, to incite in her a contempt for religion. He
has a telescope by him which enables her distinctly to see
the adjacent coast of India. She reviews some of the rites
of the natives, the repulsiveness of which she does not understand.
There is also a Turkish mosque which does not much
appeal to her, but at last she perceives a half-hidden Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
church, whose meaning and tenets he is forced reluctantly
to explain, whereupon she exclaims in exultation:
‘Christ shall be my God, and I will be a Christian!’ Understanding
that her nature is incorruptible, Melmoth gives up
regarding her as a victim. He leaves metaphysics alone
and confines his discussions solely to the phenomena of this
world. The European vessels that pass by the island furnish
him with the opportunity of describing the effects of
European civilization, and the kind of life led in European
countries. The description is bitter, cynical and pessimistic;
the darker sides of modern life&mdash;war, oppression,
unjust laws, religious contests, unequal distribution of wealth&mdash;all
is laid down in a language truly appalling, and wound
up with the remark that, among human beings, the sole
kind parents are those ‘who murder their children at the
hour of their birth, or, by medical art dismiss them before
they have seen the light; and, in so doing, they give the
only creditable evidence of parental affection.’ By enfolding
this sombre picture he tries to terrify her from wishing
ever to see the world, and thus to keep her for himself, for
in her society alone can he hope to forget his misery. She
is the only oasis in the desert of his existence, the only
human being on earth who does not instinctively shrink
from him, and who is not frightened by the lustre of his
eyes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While he sat near her on the flowers she had collected for him,&mdash;while
he looked on those timid and rosy lips that waited his signal
to speak, like buds that did not dare to blow till the sun shone on
them,&mdash;while he heard accents issue from those lips which he felt
it would be as impossible to pervert as it would be to teach the
nightingale blasphemy,&mdash;he sunk down beside her, passed his hand
over his livid brow and wiping off some cold drops, thought for
a moment he was not the Cain of the moral world, and that the
brand was effaced,&mdash;at least for a moment.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet the impression made upon Immalee by the conversations
of Melmoth is very different from what he intended.
She sheds tears and suffers with the sufferers, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
nevertheless she is seized with a longing towards the world.
She has tasted from the tree of knowledge, and her peace
of mind is gone. At the same time she feels that the society
of the stranger is far more to her than that of her mute
companions; every time he leaves her she implores him to
return, and he, on his part, cannot resist the temptation
although he sees he is destroying her happiness. She loves;
and the more he terrifies her with his wild laugh and impetuous
speech which is incomprehensible to her, the stronger
grows her love. Her idyll is at an end, and her former occupations
interest her no longer. Now she begins to prefer
‘the rocks and the ocean, the thunder of the wave, and
the sterility of the sands.’ This change fills Melmoth with
rage, as the society of Immalee thus loses the character of
a calm refuge where he may snatch a moment of rest, and
one stormy night he even contemplates her again in the
light of a victim. Yet the innocent belief of Immalee that
she is sheltered when he is near her, once more appeals to
his better feelings: he frightens her, indeed, into a state
of unconsciousness, but then, with a supreme effort, leaves
the island for ever.</p>

<p>These are the bare outlines of this singular courtship in
the Indian island. In point of language it contains the most
magnificent passages in Maturin’s production, and the characterization
also stands very high. Powerful as is the picture
of the passions and emotions of Melmoth, it is surpassed
by the art with which Immalee’s development from
a wild and thoughtless girl into a woman who loves, and
suffers for her love, is traced. The delineation of feminine
psychology, in which Maturin always excelled, is here as
masterly as it was in the case of Eva in <i>Women</i>, and there
is, in Immalee, an inner truth quite independent of her fantastical
circumstances. The very idea of dissimulation being
foreign to her, she does not think of concealing her feelings,
and amid the effusions of Melmoth&mdash;which sometimes
come to the verge of the melodramatic&mdash;she is all simplicity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
and nature. As she has never seen any other human
being, she can not understand or even surmise the exceptional
character of Melmoth, nor know that he is not, and
cannot be, a lover in the ordinary sense of the word. She
only feels that she is ready for any sacrifice for him, and
her attachment appears unaltered when they next meet
in Spain.&mdash;</p>

<p>To the passages in which Melmoth describes to Immalee
the state of the world and the conditions of human life,
there is this marginal note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As by a mode of criticism equally false and unjust, the worst
sentiments of my worst characters, (from the ravings of Bertram
to the blasphemies of Cardonneau), have been represented as <i>my
own</i>, I must here trespass so far on the patience of the reader as
to assure him, that the sentiments ascribed to the stranger are diametrically
opposite to mine, and that I have purposely put them into
the mouth of an agent of the enemy of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That Maturin had suffered much from this mode of
criticism there is no doubt, and it was certainly a cautious
thing to do to fix a note of this kind to a sentence like the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These people,” he said, “have made unto themselves kings,
that is, beings whom they voluntarily invest with the privilege
of draining, by taxation, whatever wealth their vices have left to
the rich, and whatever means of subsistence their want has left
to the poor, till their extortion is cursed from the castle to the cottage&mdash;and
this to support a few pampered favourites, who are harnassed
by silken reins to the car, which they drag over the prostrate bodies
of the multitude.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet this note cannot be taken quite literally, any more
than those prefaces of Maturin where he depreciates his
works. The discussions of Melmoth are introduced with the
remark that ‘there was a mixture of fiendish acrimony,
biting irony, and fearful truth, in his wild sketch, which
was often interrupted by the cries of astonishment, grief,
and terror, from his hearer.’ What there, accordingly, is
of ‘fearful truth’ would, at least, seem to represent Maturin’s
own views; and what Melmoth, for instance, says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
about religious wars, Maturin would doubtless have subscribed
to at any time. The tone of latent conviction in
many of these passages has been pointed out by a critic,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
with the supposition that they were dictated by the disappointments
and bitter experiences Maturin had met
with in his life, and this may well be the case. From the
literary point of view, however, the whole discourse is but
an echo of the school of Rousseau, which Maturin was in the
habit of condemning, but under whose influence the first
part of the <i>Tale of the Indians</i> was written.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Sentences from
the conversation of the old hermit in <i>Paul et Virginie</i>, like:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Le meilleur des livres, qui ne prêche que l’égalité, l’amitié, l’humilité
et la concorde, l’Evangile, a servi pendant des siècles de prétexte
aux fureurs des Européens,</p>
</div>

<p>are distinctly recalled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Intent on their settled purpose of discovering misery wherever
it could be traced, and inventing it where it could not, they have
found, even in the pure pages of that book, which, they presume to
say, contains their title to peace on earth, and happiness hereafter,
a right to hate, plunder, and murder each other.</p>
</div>

<p>Apart from this, however, the tale is remarkably original
as well as typically Maturineian. Among slight literary
influences, a reminiscence from Ossian can be traced in
a wild song of Immalee, after she has lost her peace:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The night is growing dark&mdash;but what is that to the darkness
that his absence has cast on my soul? The lightnings are glancing
round me&mdash;but what are they to the gleam of his eye when he
parted from me in anger? &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>Roar on, terrible ocean! thy waves, which I cannot count, can
never wash his image from my soul,&mdash;thou dashest a thousand
waves against a rock, but the rock is unmoved&mdash;and so would be
my heart amid the calamities of the world with which he threatens
me,&mdash;whose dangers I never would have known but for him, and
whose dangers for him I will encounter.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three years having elapsed, two persons in Madrid are,
at the same time, exciting much interest and curiosity.
One of them is a stranger of whom fearful rumours are
abroad, although there is nothing extraordinary about him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
except the appalling lustre in his eyes; the other is a most
beautiful female, who has recently turned up in Madrid as
the new-found daughter of the merchant Aliaga and who
lives in her father’s villa near the town. Once these two
persons accidentally meet in the street, which accident is
to have fatal consequences to all the members of the merchant’s
family.</p>

<p>The household of Aliaga, who himself is absent on a
voyage in the Indies, consists of his wife Donna Clara, his
son Don Fernan, and the family confessor Fra Jose. Of
these none is capable in the least of understanding Immalee&mdash;or
Isidora, as she is now called&mdash;and she feels deeply
unhappy in her new surroundings. Her unrestrained freedom
of yore has been replaced by the strictest etiquette
prescribing her duties to be ‘perfect obedience, profound
submission, and unbroken silence, except when addressed
to;’ and her warm and generous feelings are chilled by the
cold and rigid Catholicism, very different from her own
notions of religion. These latter are, indeed, considered to
denote sheer madness after she once expresses the hope
‘that the heretics in the train of the English ambassador
might not be everlastingly damned.’ Donna Clara is a woman
of rigid mind and mediocrity of intellect, chiefly occupied
in religious meditations of the narrowest kind. Her
son is a selfish and brutal character from whom no kindness
is to be expected. Isidora’s best friend is the priest, who,
in contrast to his counterpart in the Spaniard’s tale, is described
as a good and well-meaning person. Yet for the
power of the church he, too, is prepared to sacrifice everything.
Thus he, taking for pretext some superstitious rumours
concerning the early life of Isidora, insists on her
taking the veil, which scheme is indignantly opposed by
Don Fernan, who calculates that the extraordinary beauty
of his sister will be the means of the family forming, by
marriage, a connection with the highest nobility of Spain.
Before, however, either project has been realized, her meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
with Melmoth takes place, and he begins nightly to visit
her under her casement.</p>

<p>These nocturnal meetings, which form the principal contents
of the story, are quite worthy of the corresponding
scenes in the first part. The present desolate state of Isidora
is as convincingly described as her longing for the
Indian island, to dream of which is her only happiness.
The image of Melmoth is united to all that is dear to her,
and she loves him as she loves the memories of bygone days:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You were the first human being I ever saw who could teach me
language and who taught me feeling. Your image is for ever before
me, present or absent, sleeping or waking. I have seen fairer forms,&mdash;I
have listened to softer voices, I might have met gentler hearts,&mdash;but
the first, the indelible image, is written on mine, and its
characters will never be effaced till that heart is a clod of the valley.
I loved you not for comeliness,&mdash;I loved you not for gay deportment,
or fond language, or all that is said to be lovely in the eye of
a woman,&mdash;I loved you because you were my <i>first</i>,&mdash;the sole
connecting link between the human world and my heart,&mdash;the
being who brought me acquainted with that wondrous instrument
that lay unknown and untouched within me, and whose chords,
as long as they vibrate, will disdain to obey any touch but that of
their first mover,&mdash;because your image is mixed in my imagination
with all the glories of nature,&mdash;because your voice, when I heard
it first, was something in accordance with the murmur of the ocean,
and the music of the stars.”</p>
</div>

<p>In her artlessness she understands him as little as ever.
At the renewal of their intercourse she feels an innocent
desire&mdash;Maturin was too acute a psychologist to omit this
circumstance&mdash;do dazzle him with her newly-acquired
accomplishments, without being aware that the more unlike
she is to everybody else, the more attractive she must be
to him&mdash;that her sole attraction, in fact, lies in her being
something new even in his worldwide experience. Seeing,
however, that her accomplishments do not please him,
she gives up every thought of herself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She now had concentrated all her hopes, and all her heart, no
longer in the ambition <i>to be</i> beloved, but in the sole wish <i>to</i> love.
She no longer alluded to the enlargement of her faculties, the acquisition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
of new powers, and the expansion and cultivation of her taste.
She ceased to speak&mdash;she sought only to listen&mdash;then her wish
subsided into that quiet listening for his form alone, which seemed
to transfer the office of hearing into the eyes, or rather, to identify
both. She saw him long before he appeared,&mdash;and heard him
though he did not speak. They have been in each other’s presence
for the short hours of a Spanish summer’s night,&mdash;Isidora’s eyes
alternately fixed on the sun-like moon, and on her mysterious lover,&mdash;while
he, without uttering a word, leaned against the pillars of
her balcony, or the trunk of the giant myrtle-tree, which cast the
shade he loved, even by night, over his portentous expression,&mdash;and
they never uttered a word to each other, till the waving of Isidora’s
hand, as the dawn appeared, was the tacit signal for their parting.</p>
</div>

<p>The mental process which Melmoth undergoes is much
the same as before. He approaches her with withering
sarcasm and torments her with his diabolical laugh and terrible
allusions, which she bears with gentleness and patience.
She is still the only being who does not <i>understand</i> that he
is to be feared, and in whose society&mdash;as described in the
fine passage quoted above&mdash;he can obtain some rest and
oblivion; and in these moments his human nature is again
appealed to, and his better feelings prompt him once more
to leave her. The only thing Isidora ever asks of him&mdash;from
a sense of inborn dignity rather than acquired conventionality&mdash;is
to discontinue his clandestine visits and
appear before her family as her wooer. Once united to
him by the rites of the Catholic church, she promises to
follow him wherever it shall be. On one of these occasions
Melmoth finds strength to take the decisive step:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Would you then consent to unite your destiny with mine?
Would you indeed be mine amid mystery and sorrow? Would
you follow me from land to sea, and from sea to land,&mdash;a restless,
homeless, devoted being,&mdash;with the brand on your brow, and the
curse on your name? Would you indeed <i>be mine</i>? my own&mdash;my
only Immalee?”&mdash;“I would&mdash;I will!”&mdash;“Then,” answered Melmoth,
“on this spot receive the proof of my eternal gratitude. On
this spot I renounce your sight!&mdash;I disannul your engagement!&mdash;I
fly from you for ever!” And as he spoke, he disappeared.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Some time, however, after this disappearance of Melmoth,
unexpected events again throw these ill-fated lovers together.
Donna Clara receives a letter from her husband, who has
landed in Spain and is slowly making his way homewards,
to the effect that he intends to bring with him the destined
bridegroom of Isidora, a Spanish nobleman called Montilla.
Isidora learns this piece of news with great despair&mdash;but
the same night Melmoth reappears beneath her balcony.
Isidora assures him that she will be the bride of
the grave rather than of Montilla, and that her love is unaltered;
whereupon Melmoth, ‘bringing out the words with
difficulty,’ proposes that she should be ready to wed him
the following night. She consents, and the scheme is carried
out in a scene which has been called one of the greatest in
the book<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and which indeed is saturated with the keenest
suspense. The episode is typically ‘Gothic;’ it is like a
ballad of <i>Lenore</i> in prose. In the darkness they set out
and travel with supernatural rapidity towards a neighbouring
mountain where, Melmoth informs Isidora, a holy hermit
is dwelling near a ruinous monastery. Arriving at a
mountain river they hear foot-steps pursuing them, and
a figure is indistinctly seen approaching. After a short
struggle the pursuer, whom Isidora, by his voice, recognizes
to be an ancient domestic of the family, is flung into the
river. The lovers continue their way and Isidora is dragged
up into the ruins, where a hand places hers into that of
Melmoth. Almost unconscious as she is from terror, she
feels the hand to be cold as death; and afterwards it is
discovered that the hermit really had died the previous
night. This is one of the few supernatural incidents in the
story that does not directly relate to the personality of
Melmoth.&mdash;The same night Donna Clara and the priest
sit brooding over a new letter from Aliaga, in which he hints
at some terrible and mysterious tidings he has learned&mdash;it
appears later that he has met Melmoth, who, beset by
pangs of conscience, has warned him that his daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
is in danger. They are roused by a noise in the house, and
discover that Isidora’s casement is open and her room empty.
Her mother passes the night in frantic anxiety, but in the
morning Isidora is found sleeping heavily in her bed. What
has happened to her nothing can induce her to disclose,
and Donna Clara and the priest prudently determine also
to keep the matter secret. It takes Aliaga rather a long
time to get home, in spite of the warning he has received.
In the meantime Melmoth keeps on visiting his wife, but
cannot be prevailed upon to appear before the family.
Otherwise his tenderness towards Isidora increases, as there
is evidence of her becoming a mother. The night before
the event is expected to take place, Melmoth has the news
that her father and Montilla will arrive that very day, and
in the evening a great masquerade is to be held in honour
of the betrothed. Melmoth promises to be there at midnight
to take her away. The news appears to be true, and
Isidora is forced to take part in the feast. The costume of
the time fortunately conceals her altered figure, as the mask
covers her pale and haggard countenance. When the clock
strikes twelve Melmoth is beside her. They prepare to leave
the assembly, but are detected by Don Fernan, who steps
into their way. A fight ensues which ends with the death
of Don Fernan, whereat the dreaded figure of Melmoth the
Wanderer is disclosed to all the guests, some of whom recognize
him with a terror unspeakable. Isidora throws herself
upon the corpse of her brother, and Melmoth departs alone
and unmolested, nobody daring to lift a hand against him.
The house is rapidly deserted and its horrified inmates left
alone. The same night Isidora is delivered of a daughter, and,
on admitting that she is married to Melmoth, conveyed
into the prison of the Inquisition. Her parents shortly
afterwards die of grief, but the good priest is allowed to
visit her, and to him she makes a full confession of her
marriage. The Holy Office condemns her to lifelong imprisonment,
but she dies, after having strangled her child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
when the officials have come to take it from her. Before
expiring she yet confesses to Fra Jose that Melmoth has
been with her in the prison and offered to effect her liberation
on a fearful and unutterable condition. With her last
strength she has rejected it, although her love for him is
unabated.&mdash;</p>

<p>The end of the <i>Tale of the Indians</i> calls for a few remarks
from a logical point of view&mdash;if logic is to be applied to a
composition like this. It never becomes quite clear why
Melmoth brings Isidora back to her home after their wedding,
all the world being open to him; nor it is easy to understand
why he should delay the second elopement until the
house is full of guests and the disappearance of Isidora most
difficult to bring about. As he, after the failure of this
enterprise, completely loses his human character and only
appears in that of the tempter, it might be inferred that
Isidora’s last calamity is of his own contrivance; but this,
again, is contradicted by what he says after the duel with
Don Fernan: ‘Would that breathless fool had yielded to
my bidding, not to my sword&mdash;there was but one human
chord that vibrated in my heart&mdash;it is broken to-night,
and for ever!’ Those critics that derided the clumsiness
with which the schemes of Melmoth are, in general, executed,
were not entirely wrong in this instance; the lack of plausibility
in these incidents&mdash;the supernatural power of Melmoth
once taken for granted&mdash;is here of a character injurious
to the tale as a work of art.&mdash;In the descriptions of
everyday life in Aliaga’s house Maturin does not give of his
best, in spite of his having recourse to his humorous vein.
The personages themselves are depicted in rather a conventional
fashion, and the stupidity and narrow-mindedness
of Donna Clara, and the confessor’s excessive fondness for
food and drink, can bear no comparison with the humorous
passages in <i>Women</i>. Only the characterization of Isidora is
carried out with the same unfailing power to the very last.</p>

<p>The end of the <i>Tale of the Indians</i>, especially the unravelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
of the plot, contains, no doubt, some hints from
Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The parallels are but details of secondary
importance, yet too distinct to be quite overlooked. Margarete
and Isidora are equally anxious about their respective
lovers’ relations to church and religion, and propose
the same questions to them. Margarete:</p>

in what the Holy Church requires, and asks, further: ‘Do
you ever visit the church? &mdash; &mdash; Do you ever receive the
Holy Sacrament?’&mdash;Faust fights a duel with Margarete’s
brother under similar circumstances and with the same
consequence as Melmoth with Don Fernan; Margareta,

<p>The <i>Tale of the Indians</i> is once interrupted by two other
tales of considerable length. While Aliaga is travelling
homeward he passes a night at a wretched inn, where a fellow-traveller
reads to him the <i>Tale of Guzman’s Family</i>,
to the following effect.</p>

<p>Guzman is an old merchant of Seville, who has made
an enormous fortune out of nothing, and risen from an
obscure birth to a position of respect. As he lives alone,
the question of his eventual heirs excites much curiosity;
his circumstances are carefully investigated, and it is discovered
that he has a sister in life. This sister has, in
early youth, married a German musician of the name of
Walberg, turned a Protestant, been rejected by her brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
and since then lived in Germany. This appears to be true;
for once when Guzman is seized with a dangerous illness
and even given over by his physicians, he remembers his
sister and sends for the family of Walberg, that he might
be reconciled to his only relatives. At the same time he
alters his will in favour of the family. Contrary to all expectation,
he recovers before they arrive, yet the will remains
as he has fixed it, in spite of the efforts of the priests
to have it cancelled.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The only point in which Guzman
accedes to their representations, is that he determines to
refrain from all personal intercourse with his heretical relations.
This intelligence is brought to the family, at their
arrival in Seville, by Guzman’s confessor, who acts as his
agent and afterwards proves to be a man of kindness and
honour. The family consists of Walberg, his wife Ines,
and four children; later they are joined by Walberg’s aged
parents, whom he has summoned from Germany to pass
the remainder of their life with them. Sinister forebodings
fill the mind of Ines when she learns her brother’s resolution
never to see her or any member of the family. As they are,
however, amply provided for and generally considered the
sole heirs of Guzman, the displeasing resolution makes but
a slight impression on Walberg, who will not listen to his
wife’s advice that the children should be taught some profession.
So they live on in ease and comfort, until Guzman
dies&mdash;and then it is announced that he has left everything
to the church. This a blow that completely changes the
conditions of the family; their fine house is sold, and they
move into a humble abode in the suburbs, where Ines and
her daughter once more resume the domestic duties. The
good priest, who feels certain that a fraud has been committed,
does everything in his power to help them. Through
his means the matter is brought to legal arbitration, but
though the best advocates are resorted to, Walberg loses
the case. The family is gradually plunged deeper and deeper
into misery, and soon hovers on the brink of starvation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Being strangers and heretics they can obtain no work, but
are solely reduced to what the children can get together by
begging. The eldest son, Everhard, hits upon the expedient
of selling some of his blood to a surgeon, and well-nigh
expires; the daughters are beginning to be accosted by
strangers in the street; the old grandmother dies for want
of food, and the grandfather loses his reason from the same
cause. When the family has been reduced to this stage of
wretchedness, Walberg, every night he goes out to supplicate
relief from passers-by, is addressed by a stranger,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a middle-aged man, of a serious and staid demeanour, and with
nothing remarkable in his aspect except the light of two burning
eyes, whose lustre is almost intolerable. He fixes them on me
sometimes, and I feel as if there was fascination in their glare.
Every night he besets me, and few like me could have resisted his
seductions. He has offered, and proved to me, that it is in his power
to bestow all that human cupidity could thirst for, on the condition
that&mdash;I cannot utter! It is one so full of horror and impiety, that
even to listen to it, is scarce less a crime than to comply with it!</p>
</div>

<p>The same night Walberg relates this to his wife, he is
seized with a fit of insanity and proceeds to kill his children,
when, at the last moment, the priest enters with the
news that the right will is found and the family once more
the heirs of Guzman. In a short time they are restored to
health&mdash;even the grandfather recovers his reason before
he dies&mdash;and the tale ends happily:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The family then set out for Germany, where they reside in prosperous
felicity;&mdash;but to this hour Walberg shudders with horror
when he recalls the fearful temptations of the stranger, whom he
met in the nightly wanderings in the hour of his adversity, and the
horror of this visitation appears to oppress his recollection more
than even the images of his family perishing with want.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>That Godwin’s <i>St. Leon</i> makes itself remembered also in
connection with the <i>Tale of Guzman’s Family</i>, is chiefly
due to its being, upon the whole, the book which <i>Melmoth</i>
probably is most indebted to. St. Leon is, no doubt, several
times plunged into great poverty which he tries to bear
as best he can, with the assistance of a brave and faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
wife and good and amiable children; but a detailed comparison
would show little else than that these scenes, in
Godwin, are dull and powerless, whereas Maturin’s story is
just the reverse. So far from considering the <i>Tale of Guzman’s
Family</i> an imitation, one would rather be inclined to
imagine that it has sprung from personal recollections.
Both in his father’s home and his own, Maturin had seen
ease and affluence replaced by penury and want. The
situation into which the family of Walberg is reduced&mdash;which
leads to death and insanity&mdash;was, of course, extreme
beyond anything in Maturin’s experience, and a product
of furious and unrestrained imagination; but the first intimations
of disappearing wealth are brought forth with a
force and accuracy quite convincing, and among the best
pages in the tale are those treating of the horrible suspense
in which the family lives from the moment of Guzman’s
death till the publication of his will. Yet another circumstance
would go to show that the <i>Tale of Guzman’s Family</i>
had no need of literary models. In the preface to <i>Melmoth
the Wanderer</i> Maturin states that ‘the original from which
the wife of Walberg is imperfectly sketched is a living woman,
and <i>long may she live</i>;’ whence it is not unnatural
to infer that it is his own wife he is describing. So the phrase
seems to have been understood by the critic in the <i>London
Magazine</i> 1821, who adds that he would be inclined to drop
his pen and ‘weep over the misfortunes of a man of genius,
instead of scrutinizing his errors.’ The picture which Maturin
draws of the wife of Walberg is beautiful indeed. She
is the good genius of her family, as prudent as she is gentle.
She is secretly saving when her husband only thinks of
spending; when he is seized with despair, she heroically
tries to encourage him. She starves gladly herself, as long
as there is a morsel left for her children and for the aged
parents of her husband; and when he is beset by the tempter,
she exerts her last energy to support him. The wife of
Walberg is one of the incarnations of the idea of the superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
moral strength of woman, so often recurring in Maturin’s
works, and there is no reason to doubt that this idea originated
in the partner of his life.&mdash;Another figure worthy of
particular notice is the priest, with whom Maturin makes
full amends for the attacks he delivers, in <i>Melmoth</i>, upon
the dignitaries of the Catholic church. The confessor in
the <i>Tale of the Indians</i> is too much of a buffoon to be taken
seriously, but here, at last, is a Catholic prelate to whom
the interests of humanity are more than those of the church,
and who is ready to expose the crimes of his own colleagues
in order to save the life of a heretical family.</p>

<p>The style of writing, in this tale, is hardly so fine as
in the next one, although there are passages extremely
characteristic of Maturin. He was the only one of the ‘terrific’
writers of the time capable of purely aesthetical enjoyment,
almost perverse, from scenes of bodily suffering.
The description of the boy who has been selling his blood
to a surgeon could have been made by no one else:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The moonlight fell strongly through the unshuttered windows on
the wretched closet that just contained the bed. Its furniture was
sufficiently scanty, and in his spasms Everhard had thrown off
the sheet. So he lay, as Ines approached his bed, in a kind of corse-like
beauty, to which the light of the moon gave an effect that
would have rendered the figure worthy of the pencil of a Murillo,
a Rosa, or any of those painters, who, inspired by the genius of
suffering, delight in representing the most exquisite of human forms
in the extremity of human agony. A St. Bartholomew flayed, with
his skin hanging about him in graceful drapery&mdash;a St. Laurence,
broiled on a gridiron, and exhibiting his finely-formed anatomy
on its bars, while naked slaves are blowing the coals beneath
it,&mdash;even this were inferior to the form half-veiled, half-disclosed
by the moonlight as it lay. The snow-white limbs of Everhard
were extended as if for the inspection of a sculptor, and moveless,
as if they were indeed what they resembled, in hue and symmetry,
those of a marble statue. His arms were tossed above his head
and the blood was trickling fast from the opened veins of both,&mdash;his
bright and curled hair was clotted with the red stream that
flowed from his arms,&mdash;his lips were blue, and a faint and fainter
moan issued from them as his mother hung over him.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>All the personages actually appearing in the <i>Tale of
Guzman’s Family</i> are good and noble; there is no display
of revolting crimes or depraved characters, and horrible
and even disgusting as are the sufferings of the family, the
tale has little to do with the school of terror. The fact,
moreover, of its being the only one that is brought to a
happy ending, probably made it a favourite with readers.
An admiring critic in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> says that
this tale, before all others, shows ‘what Mr. Maturin is
capable of doing in his best moments of inspiration.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shortly after the stranger has read to Aliaga the tale
related above, Melmoth himself appears at the inn. He
causes&mdash;in a way unexplained&mdash;the death of the stranger
who has dared to investigate into his achievements, and the
next day associates himself with Aliaga. The merchant is
not at all charmed with his obtrusive companion, but cannot
well get rid of him; and as they slowly ride onward,
Melmoth narrates what is called <i>The Lovers’ Tale</i>.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>This time Spain is left behind, and the reader is conducted
to the England of the Restoration. The tale opens
with a short chronicle of the fortunes of the Mortimer family,
one of the oldest and noblest in the kingdom. At the time
of Charles the First the then head of the house, Sir Roger
Mortimer, ‘a man lofty alike in pride and in principle,’
distinguishes himself as one of the most fervent supporters
of the royal cause. After the defeat of the monarch he is
subjected to the reprisals, in form of fines and sequestrations,
of the victorious rebels, in addition to which his
domestic felicity is completely destroyed. His eldest son
has fallen for his king at the battle of Newbury, while his
second son has embraced the Puritan cause, married accordingly,
and finally died, having ‘fought all day at the head
of his regiment, and preached and prayed to them all night.’
The only daughter of the old loyalist also goes the wrong
way and marries an Independent preacher of the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Sandal, whom she survives. The daughter of the eldest
son, Margaret, is made the heiress of the castle, where she
resides with her grandfather and his old sister, Mrs. Ann
Mortimer, who leads the household after the death of his
brother’s wife. The daughter of the apostate son, Elinor,
is, after the death of her mother, also received at the castle
and educated there, though without expectations. Young
John Sandal, the son of the rejected daughter, is recognized
by his grandfather on the express condition of henceforth
fighting for the royal family; he has, at his own request,
been sent to sea at a very early age. At the return of Charles
the Second old Sir Roger dies of joy, but the sacrifices
of the family in the royal cause are amply compensated,
and they are once again raised among the foremost in the
country. At that period the widow Sandal takes up her
residence in the neighbourhood of the castle and sometimes
visits it, although the relations between her and her aunt
Mrs. Ann never become very cordial. From her intrigues
subsequently follows the fall of the house of Mortimer.</p>

<p>Through the re-acquired importance of the family a
distinguished position in the navy is procured for John
Sandal, and during the Dutch war he has the opportunity
of showing that the spirit of his ancestors is not dead within
him. News of valorous deeds achieved by John reaches
even the remote castle, where the gentle Elinor, who remembers
him with feelings of love in early childhood, is, more
than others, occupied in thoughts of him. When the widow
Sandal makes her appearance in the vicinity, she calls on
her every day to talk about her son, and when John arrives
to pay a visit to his mother, she is the first to meet him.
John Sandal turns out to be as good as he is brave, and his
friendship to his cousin Elinor swiftly ripens to love. Their
betrothal is greeted with joy by all except the widow, who
determines to prevent the union by any means. She has
obtained a knowledge of Sir Roger’s will, which is to the
effect that if his granddaughter Margaret marries John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
Sandal, all the immense estates are to fall to her, whereas
John, in case of his marrying Elinor, is entitled only to
a small fortune.&mdash;The wedding-day, however, is fixed; the
church is filled with guests from far and near and everything
is ready, yet the bridegroom, for some inexplicable
reason, fails to appear. Tired and anxious at the delay
Elinor retires to the vestry, from the casement window of
which she sees a rider approaching at full speed. The rider,
John Sandal, gallops past the church, casts a look of horror
upon Elinor, and disappears.</p>

<p>After the frustration of her hopes Elinor quits the castle
and takes up her abode in Yorkshire, at the house of a
strictly Puritan sister of her late mother. Peace of mind,
however, is denied her, and she lingers on in a pitiable state,
when, one day, she receives a letter from Margaret, of surprising
contents. Both old Mrs. Ann and Margaret have
assured that the faithless bridegroom shall never darken
their doors again; now Margaret announces to Elinor that
John Sandal has returned to the castle and invites her to
join them, dropping some ‘mysterious hints relative to the
interruption of the marriage.’ With a vague hope Elinor
sets out to the castle and is tenderly received by both her
cousins; the manner of John, however, clearly evinces that
there can be no question of other sentiments than a calm
friendship between them. As the betrothal of Margaret
and John is made public, her stay at the castle becomes too
painful to Elinor; she returns to Yorkshire where she leads
a life in utter seclusion, her Puritan aunt having died in
the meantime. Yet she is once more summoned to the
castle by a message from Margaret, who, now in confinement,
implores Elinor’s presence at her hour of danger. Elinor
obeys, but the gloomy forebodings of Margaret are fulfilled:
twins are born dead, and a moment afterwards the mother
also expires. Amid general despair the widow Sandal now
makes a confession to her son, with the result that his reason
is extinguished for ever. Solicitous to secure for her son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
the family estates, she had invented a story which she had
imparted to him the night before his intended nuptials with
Elinor, according to which he was not her son, but the offspring
of an ‘illicit commerce of her husband the preacher
with the Puritan mother of Elinor’&mdash;and this story she had
bound her son by oath never to disclose to Elinor.</p>

<p>After this catastrophe the life of Elinor is devoted to the
tending of the patient, whom she never leaves. It then
befalls that they are, on one of their evening walks, approached
by a stranger, who introduces himself by showing
them some slight attentions and speaking on indifferent
subjects. Their acquaintance continues some time, till it
suddenly ends by the stranger saying something that causes
Elinor wildly to rush to a neighbouring clergyman for assistance.
The clergyman happens to be the identical friend
of Melmoth the Wanderer who witnessed his apparent death
in Germany, which strange event he now discloses to Elinor;
as for Melmoth, he departs on recognizing the clergyman,
and troubles Elinor no longer. Her time passes on in the
same occupation, until her ward dies, and, in his last moments
knows her, nor does she survive him long.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This beautiful story, though little noted by commentators,
is inferior to none in the book, except the opening
chapters describing the death of the old Irish miser; on
the contrary, it seems rather the best of all the longer tales.
Maturing favourite period in English history was sure to
become to him a source of highest inspiration, whenever
he turned to it, and to his other good qualities is here added
that of an impartial historian. When Elinor, as a child,
is taken up at the castle, she is said to come to the conclusion
‘that there must be good on both sides, however
obscured or defaced by passion, where so much intellectual
power, and so much physical energy, had been displayed
by both;’ and in this spirit the controversies are treated
throughout the story. That the author’s sympathies rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
with the cavaliers is evident enough, but the errors of Puritanism&mdash;fortunately&mdash;do
not irritate him so much as
to prevent him from speaking of them with calmness, mingled
with an almost imperceptible tinge of humour. And
the peculiar spirit of the period he catches by the forelock
and never leaves hold of it; Maturin had penetrated to the
very soul of that wonderful time, when furious contests,
religious and political, splintered family ties and shook the
foundations of the empire, and when the last remnants of
ancient chivalry clashed against growing democracy and
sturdy Puritanism. Yet as the principal part of the tale
takes place <i>after</i> the Restoration, when the wounds of the
civil war are already beginning slowly to heal, he contrives
to make those turbulent events felt through the pages as
the after-rolls of a mighty storm. And as the plot consists
of the tragical downfall of a great and illustrious house,
there is, in the style, something like the glow of an autumnal
sun setting over a rich and glorious landscape. It is,
in fact, in autumn&mdash;the season Maturin loved best&mdash;that
most of the incidents occur, and the pages abound in magnificent
descriptions of nature, like the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Elinor took the path through the park, and, absorbed in new
feelings, was for the first time insensible of its woodland beauty,
at once gloomy and resplendent, mellowed by the tints of autumnal
colouring, and glorious with the light of an autumnal evening,&mdash;till
she was roused to attention by the exclamations of her companion,
who appeared rapt into delight at what he beheld. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; As
they approached the Castle, the scene became glorious beyond
the imagination of a painter, whose eye has dreamed of sunset in
foreign climes. The vast edifice lay buried in shade,&mdash;all its varied
and strongly charactered features of tower and pinnacle, bartizan
and battlement, were melted into one dense and sombrous mass.
The distant hills with their conical summits, were still clearly defined
in the dark-blue heaven, and their peaks still retained a hue of purple
so brilliant and lovely, that it seemed as if the light had loved to
linger there, and, parting, had left that tint as the promise of a glorious
morning. The woods that surrounded the Castle stood as dark,
and apparently as solid as itself. Sometimes a gleam like gold
trembled over the tufted foliage of their summits, and at length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
through a glade which opened among the dark and massive boles
of the ancient trees, one last rich and gorgeous flood of light burst
in, turned every blade of grass it touched into emerald for a moment,&mdash;passed
on its lovely work&mdash;and parted. The effect was so instantaneous,
brilliant, and evanishing, that Elinor had scarce time
for a half uttered exclamation, as she extended her arm in the direction
where the light had fallen so brightly and so briefly.</p>
</div>

<p>This style is sustained throughout the narrative, but
instead of rendering it monotonous, it only makes the
‘atmosphere’ intense and harmonious in the extreme, which
is the chief merit of <i>The Lovers’ Tale</i>. The characters, if
not exactly conventional, are less originally conceived. Margaret
and Elinor are a pair of heroines known from countless
romances of all ages: the former high-spirited and
vivacious, demanding homage and obtaining it at the same
moment; the latter tender, pale, soft and contemplative,
yet not without traits of distinct individuality. The characterization
of John Sandal is not successful&mdash;it is the
only thing in the tale which is not&mdash;he is too gentle, too
‘milky’ to be a young sailor and warrior, and is depicted
with a considerable amount of sentimentality. He appears,
however, but little; the principal personage is Elinor, whose
hopes and sufferings are delineated with a psychological
insight recalling corresponding passages in <i>Women</i>. Like
Zaira, in the last-named romance, Elinor in vain seeks forgetfulness
in philanthrophy and religion. In her aunt’s house
nothing is changed since her earliest childhood. The Puritanic
ideals and the memories of celebrated preachers are
still cherished by the old maid with undiminished force;
but Elinor cannot, in spite of desperate endeavours, find
consolation in what once was all in all to her, too. It is
not only that her heart is broken; she belongs to a new
time, and her views have been enlarged during her life in
the castle. The difference between two generations, in the
persons of these two women, is brought forth with exquisite
fineness, and the great and heroic qualities in Puritanism
are freely admitted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An old non-conformist minister, a very Saint John for sanctity
of life, and simplicity of manners, had been seized by a magistrate
while giving the word of consolation to a few of his flock who had
met at the cottage of her aunt.</p>

<p>The old man had supplicated for a moment’s delay on the part
of the civil power, and its officers, by an unusual effort of toleration
or of humanity, complied. Turning to his congregation, who, amid
the tumult of the arrest, had never risen from their knees, and
only changed the voice of supplication from praying with their pastor
to praying for him,&mdash;he quoted to them that beautiful passage
from the prophet Malachi, which appears to give such delightful
encouragement to the spiritual intercourse of Christians,&mdash;“Then
they that feared the Lord, spoke often to one another, and the
Lord heard it,” etc. As he spoke, the old man was dragged away
by some rougher hands, and died soon after in confinement.</p>

<p>On the young imagination of Elinor, this scene was indelibly
written. Amid the magnificence of Mortimer Castle, it had never
been effaced or obscured, and now she tried to make herself in love
with the sounds and the scene that had so deeply touched her infant
heart.</p>

<p>Resolute in her purposes, she spared no pains to excite this reminiscence
of religion&mdash;it was her last resource. Like the wife of
Phineas, she struggled to bear an heir of the soul, even while she
named him <i>Ichabod</i>,&mdash;and felt the glory was departed. She went
to the narrow apartment,&mdash;she seated herself in the very chair
that venerable man occupied when he was torn from it, and his
departure appeared to her like that of an ascending prophet. She
would <i>then</i> have caught the folds of his mantle, and mounted with
him, even though his flight had led to prison and to death. She
tried, by repeating his last words, to produce the same effect they
had once had on her heart, and wept in indescribable agony at feeling
those words had no feeling now for her.</p>
</div>

<p>The faint hope wakened in her half-benumbed heart
by Margaret’s first letter is soon extinguished. Gradually
she loses her beauty and her strength, and when addressed
by Melmoth she is, bodily, almost as weak as her ward.
It has been said<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> that it is not clear why he tempts Elinor;
it must be presumed that he would have the power to restore
the mind of John, though his chance of succeeding with
Elinor is certainly slight, she being altogether resigned to
her fate.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>That <i>The Lovers’ Tale</i> is told by Melmoth himself, and
told in such a way as it is, belongs to those curiosities in
the composition of the book, which simply must be accepted
as freaks of a careless yet self-conscious imagination that
follows laws of its own. Aliaga, naturally enough, is at
a loss to comprehend how this tale could be applied to him;
but the next day, as they continue their journey together,
Melmoth briefly recapitulates the early history of Isidora&mdash;the
details of the shipwreck and her discovery later are now
first revealed to the reader&mdash;adding that Aliaga should
not lose a moment to save his daughter. Notwithstanding
this warning, Aliaga allows concerns of business to detain
him, and in the meantime the fatal nuptials of Melmoth and
Isidora take place. After the Indians’ tale then has been
brought to an end, the thread of the original narrative is at
last resumed and the reader once more conducted to where
young John Melmoth and the Spaniard Monçada are sitting
in the desolate Irish country-house. Their conversation is
interrupted by the sudden appearance of the subject of all
these adventures. The term of his supernaturally prolonged
existence is drawing to a close, and the terrible lustre of his
eyes is already extinguished. He assures the horrified youths
that there is nothing to fear; his wanderings are finished,
and the reason for these wanderings need no longer be kept
secret, any more than the failure of all his pursuits:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No one has ever exchanged destinies with Melmoth the Wanderer.
<i>I have traversed the world in the search, and no one, to gain that world,
would lose his own soul!</i> Not Stanton in his cell&mdash;nor you, Monçada,
in the prison of the Inquisition&mdash;nor Walberg, who saw his
children perishing with want&mdash;nor&mdash;another&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>After this confession the Wanderer asks for a moment’s
repose, to sleep for the last time in his human existence.
His dreams, however, are filled with a grand and awful
vision of the realm of death which is awaiting him and which
he has no hope of escaping. During the night mysterious
voices issue from the room in which he has shut himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
In the morning the room is empty, but footsteps can be
traced up to a rock overlooking the sea. John and Monçada
follow the steps until they gain the last summit of the rock:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ocean was beneath&mdash;the wide, waste, engulphing ocean!
On a crag beneath them, something hung as floating to the blast.
Melmoth clambered down and caught it. It was the handkerchief
which the Wanderer had worn about his neck the preceding night&mdash;that
was the last trace of the Wanderer!</p>

<p>Melmoth and Monçada exchanged looks of silent and unutterable
horror, and returned slowly home.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The conclusion of <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> is very impressive;
the descriptions are well-balanced, suggestive, and not
too furious, although, in certain details, not decidedly original
in invention. As in the transformation of Melmoth
by an apparent death an influence from a contemporary
work of the school of terror can be discerned, his real death
can be traced back to the <i>Faustus</i> of Marlowe.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The preparations
of Faustus and Melmoth for the dreadful last
night are carried on in the same way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Faustus.</i> Aye, pray for me&mdash;pray for me&mdash;and whatever noise
soever you hear, come not unto me, for nothing can rescue me.</p>
</div>

<p>Melmoth says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Leave me&mdash;I must be alone for the few last hours of my mortal
existence&mdash;men retire&mdash;leave me alone&mdash;whatever noises you
hear in the course of the awful night that is approaching, come not
near this apartment, at the peril of your lives.</p>
</div>

<p>The final fulfilment of the bond, however, is only suggested
by Maturin, while in Marlowe the devils who come
to fetch Faustus are actually brought to the stage. In this
respect the end of <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> differs, much to
its advantage, from the end also of <i>The Monk</i>,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> where the
enemy in person takes hold of Ambrosio, soars with him in the
air and dashes him to pieces against a sharp point of rock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the story of <i>Melmoth</i>, on one of the last pages of
the book, turns back to the Irish country-house, the author
expresses a fear that the reader has, perhaps, forgotten the
existence of young John Melmoth. If he has not, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
at least have had plenty of time to do so; for the whole
fabric of the work is nothing but a gigantic digression from
the first action, in the form of tales within tales, told and
read and read and told by somebody to somebody else,
in an exceedingly intricate way rendering a general view
of them a matter of considerable difficulty. The construction
of <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> is extravagant beyond any degree
reached by <i>Montorio</i> or <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i>, and has been
subjected to severe criticism. Saintsbury<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> calls the arrangement
‘execrably bad,’ wondering ‘how anything quite so
bad in form can have been put forth by anybody so clever.’
One explanation would be that this form implies an intentional
disregard of the rules of composition, rather than
a failure of ability to adhere to them, in other words, that
the general effect is not calculated to rest upon regularity
of construction, any more than in, for instance, the second
part of <i>Faust</i>. But even if&mdash;which is more probable&mdash;Maturin
really sat down to compose a story of ‘ordinary’
proportions and was unconsciously carried away on the
wings of his ungovernable imagination, the general impression
left by the book is such as to make the defects in its
arrangement decidedly appear a question of secondary
importance, just as the many literary reminiscences which
present themselves during the perusal, cannot detract anything
from the originality of the hero. Little as he actually
appears, he is the locomotive power without which the
whole would collapse, and he is remembered still when
everything else is forgotten. From behind the various and
manifold scenes of this amazing labyrinth, there arises the
pale figure of the Wanderer, terrible and diabolical, yet
suffering and despairing, to bear witness to his own defeat
and the victory of human nature, so weak and yet so invincible,
the object of at once his hatred and his adoration;
and is it not, when we stand face to face with this wonderful
creation of a great genius, indifferent where and when
and by whom the separate tales are related? That the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
Wanderer, however, is capable of making so powerful an
impression, is due to this curious fact, that the book, in
its most essential feature, does not at all correspond to the
passage in Maturin’s sermon which he maintains to have
inspired it.</p>

<p>Several writers, from the most worthless to the most
competent, have expressed their wonder at the very poor
success Melmoth, with all his supernatural endowments,
can boast of. The savage critic in the <i>Quarterly Review</i><a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
sneers that Melmoth ‘during his peregrination of two centuries,
does less mischief than a clever mortal would have
done;’ and Edgar Allan Poe<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> observes that Melmoth
‘labours indefatigably, through three octavo volumes, to
accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any
common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.’
The common devils certainly are more fortunate, and their
difference from Maturin’s hero is conspicuous enough. In
Balzac’s half-parody, <i>Melmoth Reconcilié</i> (1835), the Wanderer
is delivered of his curse by a criminal, a cashier who
has committed a fraud and is desirous to escape his sentence,
and afterwards it passes from hand to hand among
similar individuals. In Stevenson’s story of <i>The Bottle Imp</i>
(1893); which has the same motive, the miracle-working
and soul-destroying imp is at last, without subsequent
repentance, purchased by a drunken boatswain who reckons
he is going to hell anyway. The cause of Melmoth’s failure,
and the precise character of his uncleverness, which consists
in his strange ignorance whom to address, is in obvious
contradiction to the sermon, where the final sin is declared
to be too frightful even to those who have ever so much</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>departed from the Lord, disobeyed His will, and disregarded
His word.</p>
</div>

<p>Now the persons who are subjected to the temptations
of Melmoth the Wanderer have done nothing of the kind:
on the contrary, most of them come as near perfection as
poor human nature can possibly do. The tempter invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
takes care to accost those with whom he is least likely
to succeed. He leaves unnoticed a character like the parricide,
who is said to be beyond the redemption of a Saviour,
and who, it must be assumed, would most joyfully accept
the bond&mdash;to waste his time and energy on Alonzo di Monçada,
whom he perceives to be as firm as any rock. Of
Stanton, of Walberg, of Isidora, of Elinor, not one single
wrong deed is recorded which would speak for the probability
of their succumbing to his seductions. To all the
tales, it has finely been observed,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> can be applied a motto
from <i>Faust</i>: ‘ein guter Mensch in seinem dunkeln Drange
ist sich des rechten Weges wohl bewusst;’ but it is not the
good instinct in the good, but the good instinct in the bad,
which Maturin, in the preface, promises to demonstrate.
In consequence, however, of this ‘blunder,’ the character
of Melmoth the Wanderer becomes so impressive, so impassioned,
so distinct from all common men and common
devils. The attraction exercised upon him by the good has
its root in what there is human in him; what causes him
his keenest sufferings is not that he is shut out of paradise
but that he is shut out of the community of the good among
human beings; and what he insists on trying, amid rage
and despair, is that some one of those <i>good</i> would voluntarily
share his fate and relieve his bitter loneliness. The relation
of Melmoth to mankind is marked by that intense sense of
loneliness, that sense of being ‘among them, but not of
them,’ or, as Maturin says, ‘mingling with, yet distinct
from all his species’&mdash;which goes through the romantic
literature of the period and which indeed is genuinely romantic
in its implication of something exceptional, something
outside the common rules of life. The anguish of
loneliness is shared alike by good and bad, by all whom
adverse circumstances or else their own bodily or mental
deformities have placed in a solitary position in the world.
In <i>Montorio</i>, Ippolito is undeservedly overtaken by the
fate which Melmoth deliberately invokes upon himself; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
their anguish is the same. It is felt by St. Leon, the moment
he attains earthly immortality and understands that those
whom he has loved can mean nothing to him any longer;
it is felt by the Black Dwarf when he contemplates the
happiness of the strong and the beautiful, which he is never
to share; and even the miserable monster created by Frankenstein
prays for one being of the same species as himself,
who might smile upon him and not answer his approaches
with curses and maledictions. It was Maturin’s desire to
dwell upon this emotion that in the long run decided the
mould of the characters in <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> in a way,
perhaps, not intended by him from the first. Viewed in the
light of this same emotion, the contempt of Melmoth for
his victims is only half-real, nor is it probable that Maturin
meant him to appear so superior to humanity as he is shown
by Baudelaire<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> in his well-known <i>Essay de l’essence du rire</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Quoi de plus grand, quoi de plus puissant relativement à la
pauvre humanité que ce pale et ennuyé Melmoth? Et pourtant,
il y a en lui un côté faible, abject, antidivin et antilumineux. Aussi
comme il rit, comme il rit, se comparant sans cesse aux chenilles
humaines, lui si fort, si intelligent, lui pour qui une partie des lois
conditionelles de l’humanité, physiques et intellectuelles, n’existent
plus! Et ce rire est l’explosion perpétuelle de sa colère et de sa
souffrance. Il est, qu’on me comprenne bien, la résultante nécessaire
de sa double nature contradictoire, qui est infiniment grande relativement
à l’homme, infiniment vile et basse relativement au Vrai
et au Juste absolus.</p>
</div>

<p>The members of this <i>pauvre humanité</i> still represent the
power of absolute Justice and Truth, the power so infinitely
stronger than Melmoth. Theirs is the ultimate triumph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> created, at its first appearance,
a greater sensation than any of Maturin’s previous novels.
Economically it also was something of a success: the profits
it brought to the author are said<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> to have amounted
to 500 pounds. A second edition appeared the following
year as well as a French translation, <i>Melmoth, ou l’Homme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
errant</i>, by J. Cohen, and a ‘free’ German translation called
<i>Melmoth der Wanderer</i>.&mdash;All the works of Maturin, except
<i>Manuel</i> and <i>Fredolfo</i>, were translated into French soon
after their appearance in English, and with the rendering
of <i>Melmoth</i> his fame became definitely established in that
country, where, in fact, it has always been greater than in
England. A. A. Watts says<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> that his father, while travelling
in France, possessed a passport to the romantic circles
as the friend of that ‘triste et terrible Maturin.’&mdash;In
1823 the romance was published in the form of a melodrama
in three acts, by B. West. This production is a combination
of the <i>Tale of Guzman’s Family</i> and the <i>Tale of the Indians</i>;
Isidora is represented as the daughter of Walberg, and has
loved Melmoth in her youth. Walberg and Isidora are
both, through the machinations of Melmoth, thrown into
the prison of the Inquisition, whence they are rescued by
another lover of hers, while Melmoth is killed by thunder.
The play is without any literary value whatever, but shows
clearly which two tales were most appreciated by the public.&mdash;The
principal periodicals of the time also reviewed
<i>Melmoth</i> at a considerable length, although, for the most
part, with a negative result. In the <i>Quarterly Review</i> Croker
raged against the book even more furiously than he
had done against <i>Women</i>, pronouncing it to be the very
acme of all that is execrable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Indeed, Mr. Maturin has contrived, by a ‘<i>curiosa infelicitas</i>,’
to unite in this work all the worst particularities of the worst modern
novels. Compared with it, Lady Morgan is almost intelligible&mdash;The
Monk, decent&mdash;The Vampire, amiable&mdash;and Frankenstein, natural.
We do not pronounce this judgment hastily, and we pronounce
it with regret&mdash;we honour Mr. Maturin’s profession even when he
debases it, and if ‘Melmoth’ had been only silly and tiresome, we
should gladly have treated it with silent contempt; but it unfortunately
variegates its stupidity with some characteristics of a more
disgusting kind, which our respect for good manners and decency
obliges us to denounce.</p>
</div>

<p>After declaring, in italics, that the hero of the book is
<i>the Devil himself</i>, the reviewer solemnly accuses the author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
of nonsense, want of veracity, ignorance, blasphemy and
brutality, and a dark, cold-blooded, pedantic obscenity;
and finishes his article with a hint that it certainly is quite
right that the Church does not provide subsistence for
him.&mdash;That critics, upon the whole, spoke unfavourably
of <i>Melmoth</i> is not to be wondered at. The school of terror
had irrevocably had its day, and very different literary
ideals were being established. The magic art of Scott held
a strong sway over all minds, while the well-bred drawing-room
adventures of Maria Edgeworth and Jane Austen were
now, in their turn, felt as a relief and a liberation from the
wilder forms of romanticism. The extravagances and horribly
startling incidents in Maturin’s romance were enough
to cover its powerful originality and lasting merits&mdash;which
probably would be the case did the book appear to-day.
Yet the author’s genius was unreservedly admitted even
by most of those who disapproved of the style and contents
of <i>Melmoth</i>; the end of the article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
is characteristic, its tone being as dignified as that of the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> is base:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let it not be imagined, from any thing we have now said, that
we think meanly of Mr. Maturin’s genius and abilities. It is precisely
because we hold both in respect that we are sincerely anxious to
point out their misapplication; and we have extended our observations
to a greater length than we contemplated, partly because we
fear his strong though unregulated imagination, and unlimited
command of glowing language, may inflict upon us a herd of imitators
who ‘possessing the contortions of the sybil without her inspiration’
will deluge us with dull, turgid, and disgusting enormities;&mdash;and
partly because we are not without hopes that our animadversions,
offered in a spirit of sincerity, may induce the Author himself
to abandon this new Apotheosis of the old Raw-head-and-bloody-bones,
and assume a station in literature more consonant to his high
endowments, and to that sacred profession to which, we understand,
he does honour by the virtues of his private life.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany</i> writes
essentially to the same purport:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is one point of resemblance between this author and his
hero. They both, in a different way, possess very considerable
powers, which seem to have some invisible and mysterious limit,
beyond which they cannot pass. The wild and wonderful, the odd
and eccentric, seems to be Mr. Maturin’s chosen province;&mdash;into
the regions of nature and probability he is either unable or unwilling
to penetrate. Perhaps this is saying too much, but, if he does make
an advance into these quiet precincts, his love of extravagance and
exaggeration immediately leads him back into his wonted path. &mdash; &mdash; It
is difficult to understand the construction of a mind so pregnant
with every aggravation of mental and bodily suffering, that it seems
absolutely to luxuriate, not only in the pain it describes, but in
that which he produces in his readers. Surrounded as he is with
terrible objects, and gleams of sulphureous flame, which his hero
is ever and anon presenting to our view, the reverend author appears
to our imagination like some Vulcan of the anvil, assiduously labouring
and forging shackles, bolts, and instruments of torture, with
this difference, that with the poor mechanic it was not matter of
choice, whereas Mr. Maturin, with all the flowery paths of fiction
open to him, has preferred this tortuous and gloomy one.</p>
</div>

<p>The only one who expresses himself with unrestrained
admiration is the critic in the <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>&mdash;also
referred to once above. Even he, it is true, points
out that there are faults and errors in Maturin’s writings;
but he admits that they are more than atoned for by the
merits:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And yet, where is the lover of imaginative excitement, that ever
laid down one of his books unfinished&mdash;or the man of candour
and discrimination, who ever denied, after reading through any
of them, that Maturin is gifted with a genius as fervently powerful
as it is distinctly original&mdash;that there is ever and anon a truth of
true poetry diffused over the thickest chaos of his absurdities&mdash;and
that he walks almost without a rival, dead or living, in many of the
darkest, but, at the same time, the most majestic circles of romance?</p>
</div>

<p>This critic, however, could hardly be taken seriously
by the author, inasmuch as he places <i>Montorio</i> before the
present work:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are far from saying that Mr. Maturin should write less&mdash;but
we do say, that he should write a great deal more&mdash;observe
a great deal more&mdash;and correct a great deal more. If he does not,
he may depend upon it he will never fulfil the rich promise of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
<i>Montorio</i>; for that, we rather think, was his first&mdash;and, we are
quite sure, is the best of all his performances.</p>
</div>

<p>It is of interest to notice these opinions; for, however
slight their authority, they seem to have had the desired
effect of checking the ‘extravagances’ of Maturin’s genius&mdash;so
much the worse for literature. His desire to please&mdash;for
such desire there was in his temperament, quite apart
from all pecuniary considerations&mdash;was once more discouraged,
and he began to grow weary of being told the
same things over and again. It was several years before
he again produced a novel, and when he did, he painfully
strove to adhere to patterns universally accepted, and
avoid displaying those peculiarities which were distinctly
his own, but the absence of which to a production of his
irreparably meant the loss of vital power, notwithstanding
a small temporary success. A sense of ultimate failure and
disappointment has, among other things, its share in the
unmistakable gloom cast over Maturin’s last years.</p>

</p>


<p>Maturin’s last period opens with a poetical enterprise
which is bound up with a mystery exactly opposite to that
appertaining to the publication of the <i>Waterloo</i> prize poem
in 1815. In 1821 appeared a lengthy poem in blank verse,
called <i>The Universe</i>, under the name of the Rev. C. R. Maturin,
received&mdash;very undeservedly&mdash;with something
like acclamation. The real authorship of the poem was,
even at the time, claimed by Mr. James Wills, a name afterwards
not quite&mdash;though nearly&mdash;unknown in the world
of letters; but it was not until 1874 that the case was
brought before the public. For the sake of the composition
itself it would be unnecessary long to dwell upon the question,
had not the controversy called forth the publication
of a manuscript of Wills, which throws an interesting, if
not entirely agreeable, light upon his acquaintance with
Maturin and the circumstances connected with the origin
of <i>The Universe</i>.</p>

<p>A correspondent in the <i>Notes and Queries</i><a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>&mdash;who was
a great admirer of the poem&mdash;happened, in the year mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
above, to allude to its disputed authorship and utter
some doubts as to the statements of Wills. Against this
view the surviving family of that writer energetically protested;
two sons of Wills, referring to a note in the second
edition of Lord John Russell’s biography of Moore,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and
producing two or three utterances of some of their father’s
friends who were initiated into the secret, put about the
following statements concerning <i>The Universe</i>. Maturin was
engaged by Colburn to compose for him a poem consisting
of a thousand lines. The renumeration&mdash;500 pounds&mdash;was
paid in advance; but, having spent it, Maturin found
the fulfilment of his engagement to be encumbered with
insurmountable difficulties. Being at a loss how to get on
with the work, he was shown a poem of Wills, then a very
young man. Maturin pathetically entreated him to lend it
to him for use, promising, first, to let Colburn know of the
transaction, and secondly, to reveal the real authorship after
the publication; neither of which promises was kept, the poem
being read and reviewed as a production of Maturin’s.</p>

<p>In the polemics in the <i>Notes and Queries</i> the Wills family&mdash;who
also considered the <i>Universe</i> a work of uncommon
merit&mdash;had the last word, and their assertions were, a
little later, supported by the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
whose editor had received a record in the handwriting of
Wills, found between the covers of an old copy of the poem
and sent to Dublin by Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus, the well-known
London publishers. In this record, which the editor
supposes to have been written for the benefit of Lord Russell
before the publication of the second edition of his life
of Moore, Wills relates that he had composed the poem in
the years 1819 and 1820,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> while residing at Bray, the
then most fashionable watering-place in the neighbourhood
of Dublin. He intended it to be a very great work which
was to fill up all his life-time; but having written upwards
of 800 lines, he made a new acquaintance of whose appearance
he gives the following description:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was an accession of guests (at the table d’hôte), and among
them a very remarkable-looking gentleman attracted my attention,
and I was struck by the extreme precision of his dress, his handsome
and well sitting black wig, which, on a first glance, looked like a
splendid head of hair, his silver spectacles, neatly cut features, and
the imposing modulation of his deep voice. Had he been some years
younger, I should have said there was a little shade of the clerical
dandy in his appearance. As it was I thought I could discern the
air of one who aimed to be very <i>recherché</i> in his manners and conversation,
and that all his personal advantages were a little overdone.
Who he could be I had no notion.</p>

<p>I was seated at a side table: but when the cloth was removed
he beckoned to me, and I went and took a seat next to him. He
pushed his bottle to me, and asked me to join him in his wine, and
addressed his conversation entirely to me. I presently took exception
to some fallacy which he let drop: and as he seemed disposed
to contest the point (whatever it was) the conversation degenerated
into argument. The gentleman I soon found, though extremely
pointed, witty and epigrammatic, and very happy in allusion, had
very little power in disputation, and he presently gave in with a good
grace.</p>
</div>

<p>In the course of the same day Wills was formally introduced
to his opponent, who he had learnt, was Maturin.
Their acquaintance soon ripened into intimacy. The fascinating
personality of the novelist cast a strong spell over
Wills, although he received the impression that Maturin
was ‘a little too flattering’ and not quite sincere. When
the transaction as to the poem was then proposed to him,
Wills felt extreme reluctance, but at last yielded, overcome
by Maturin’s persuasions and the consideration that
Maturin’s family, to whom he had been introduced, would
be ruined if the money had to be refunded to Colburn. The
accomplishment of this great work is told by Wills with
a naive open-heartedness, amusing indeed when regarded
in the light of the controversy in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, where
his sons seriously maintain that both Scott and Campbell
considered <i>The Universe</i> the best thing produced by Maturin,
and the other party as seriously declares it to contain
passages equal to Milton:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I then went stoutly to work and as I had engaged to expand my
poem into 2,000 lines within the next month, without the materials
which the original plan required, I diluted it with whatever came
uppermost. It was thus easily completed within the time, and copied
from my own first draught by different transcribers as I had insisted
on preserving my own M. S., which I still have. I also wished to
keep possession of my plan and the original passages, all of which
had been carefully elaborated, though the filling up was carelessly
done.</p>
</div>

<p>The poem being completed and sent to the publisher, it
became clear to Wills that Maturin was determined not to
reveal the secret. It came out, however, ‘with a celerity
truly surprising;’ the literary circles of Dublin were divided
in two contesting parties, the one standing by Maturin,
the other by Wills, and the matter was eagerly discussed
in the drawing-rooms of Lady Morgan and the Mrs. Smith
mentioned by Moore. The former was also deeply impressed
by the production; when assured by Wills that Maturin
never wrote a line of it, she answered, ‘well, then, you
must do something very considerable to convince the world
you could have written it.’ Nevertheless Wills seems to
have succeeded in convincing Lady Morgan, for it was she
who, according to him, communicated the particulars to
Colburn. When Wills some time afterwards met the publisher
in London, he presented Wills with all the remaining
copies of the stock, hinting that the affair ‘had been injurious
to Mr. Maturin in his relations with him as a publisher.’&mdash;</p>

<p>In connection with this version of Wills it is not out of
place to quote a passage from an unpublished letter of Maturin
to Sir Charles Morgan, dated 1821:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash; &mdash; Apropos to the <i>cursed</i> booksellers, you can render me a
most essential service by simply making an inquiry. I have Mr. Colburn’s
written engagement to give £ 500 for my present work. I
wrote to Charles Phillips three months ago to request he would
inform C. that the work was more than half completed, that I was
willing to place the M. S. in his hands and depended on his fulfilling
his engagement. I have never had a line from Phillips in answer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
though I stated my distress to him repeatedly and in the most urgent
terms. Now, my dear friend, if without <i>committing me</i> you could
make C. speak out, it would relieve me from considerable anxiety.</p>
</div>

<p>This seems to prove that the £ 500 was not paid in advance,
and that Maturin had written a large part of some
work agreed upon with Colburn, before he received anything
for it. Whether the manuscript here referred to was
published as a constituent part of <i>The Universe</i> it is hazardous
to decide; if it was, Maturin had probably lost all
interest in the poem and entreated Wills to complete it&mdash;the
alternative being that the manuscript was deemed unfit,
and Wills supplied all the materials. The poem itself gives
little clue to the mystery. When speaking of <i>The Universe</i>,
Wills more than once alludes to the ‘effective passages’
and the ‘filling up;’ but to a modern reader it is not easy
to distinguish which is which, the whole being extraordinarily
ineffective. The subject resolves itself into something
that cannot possibly be firmly grasped. A contemporary
critic<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> says not inappropriately: ‘Where in the name of
criticism and common sense, could he begin with a subject
that had no beginning, or finish with that which, being infinite
and eternal, can have no end? He has followed no
plan&mdash;he has given his fancy the rein. His flight is wild
and discursive, but indicates a bearing in no particular
direction. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; His poem is not a <i>whole</i>: any man might
as well have tried to cram the solar system into a cockle-shell
as to produce a complete and finished poem on such
a subject.’ The following passage belongs, in the critic’s
opinion, to the happiest in the poem:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These lines are, as a matter of fact, neither better nor
worse than any others of the two thousand of which this
sorry production consists. There are no traces of the rugged
beauty of <i>Bertram</i> and <i>Fredolfo</i>, and it is really difficult
to imagine that Maturin had any part in the work. On
the other hand it must be admitted that it is equally inferior
to the poetry later produced by Wills.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The matter
ought to have been taken very quietly by those whom it
concerned, nor did it, to judge from the record of Wills,
stop their friendly intercourse. It may lastly be mentioned
that Maturin dedicated <i>The Universe</i> to his old antagonist
Samuel Taylor Coleridge; which must have happened either
in a fit of Christian forgiveness or of deliberate irony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The picture which Wills draws of Maturin is, it will be
observed, totally different from the description quoted in
connection with his mode of composing <i>Melmoth</i>. It also
differs from what other scanty records there are preserved
of Maturin, which all agree that he was, at that time, beginning
to lead a retired life and appear but little in society.
His pecuniary embarrassments were extremely distressing;
the profits he had reaped by <i>Melmoth</i> and <i>The Universe</i>
had probably been swallowed up by the old debt he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
contracted some time about 1815, besides which he undoubtedly
was something of a spendthrift and unpractical in
business-transactions. His home had undergone a melancholy
change since the success of <i>Bertram</i>, as depicted by
the writer in <i>Douglas Jerrold’s Shilling Magazine</i> 1846:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inside of the house was gloomy and melancholy in the extreme:
just the house for the romancist who penned “Melmoth.”
The dull kitchen candle of the servant threw but a faint light; and
my feet struck with a lonely sound on the naked flags of the hall,
which was barely furnished with two chairs surmounted by his
crest, a galloping horse; the stairs were without carpets. On entering
the drawing-room, it almost appeared to be unfurnished. A
single drugget partly covered the floor, and a small table stood in
the centre: but the entire end nearest the door was occupied by
a divan covered with scarlet, which appeared strangely out of character
with the general meagreness of the apartment; beside the
folding-doors was a square piano; at the fire was placed an old
armchair, in which I afterwards saw him sit for many a weary hour,
till three or four o’clock in the morning, while writing the “Albigenses;”
and on a small work-table between the windows lay a very
ancient writing-desk. Such was my first glimpse of the author’s domicile,
which had once been a witness of very different scenes.</p>
</div>

<p>The gloominess of Maturin’s existence was brightened
by the return of Lady Morgan to her native country in
1821, after an absence of several years abroad. The little
governess who had earned her first laurels with <i>The Wild
Irish Girl</i> was now transformed into one of the foremost
literary celebrities of the day. In 1812 Miss Owenson had
become the wife of Dr. Thomas Charles Morgan, physician
to the Marquis of Abercorn, who had shortly before been
‘knighted by the viceroy&mdash;at a hint, it is said, from the
doctor’s enterprising fiancée. She had, since then, published
numerous novels, amongst others the Irish story <i>O’Donnel</i>
(1814). Her greatest fame, however, was due to the extensive
work on <i>France</i> (1817), the strongly liberal views of
which had roused the fury of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> and
caused the fierce contest of which Maturin also had borne
his share of the brunt in the vehement attacks upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
best romances. From the rare and brief political utterances
in Maturin’s works, sermons, and letters, it may be gathered
that he rather inclined to toryism; but uninterested as he
was in politics, his opinions did not in any way bias his
regard for Lady Morgan, of whom he used to speak ‘in terms
of the most extravagant admiration.’<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Though the two
were the only authors of repute residing in Dublin, there
was no kind of jealousy between them. The character of
Lady Morgan was broad-minded and generous, and her
desire to help Maturin was sincere beyond any doubt. Her
weekly <i>réunions</i> in Kildare Street, pleasantly described by
her biographer,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> were among the few relaxations Maturin
allowed himself in his later years:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this agreeably situated mansion there was regularly held for
a long series of years, a still more voluminous series of most delightful
and select literary réunions, which are remembered by the surviving
few who had the privilege of access, with enthusiastic feelings
of pride and pleasure. A constant guest was the brilliant, eccentric,
and almost forgotten Charles Robert Maturin. Domestic sorrows
and pecuniary reverses threw a gloom over the later years of his
existence; and, as a contemporary record informs us, every inducement
failed to make him desert his melancholy hearth save the
intellectual circle which Lady Morgan illuminated by her sparkling
wit, or the romantic solitudes of Wicklow wherein some of his richest
veins of inspiration had been caught in happier bygone days.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the domestic sorrows was the loss of a child, in
1821, immediately after its birth. When Lady Morgan called
to inquire after Mrs. Maturin during her confinement, Maturin
sent her this reply: ‘My angel is better, The Cherub
is flown’&mdash;which words she noted down on a letter she
received from him shortly afterwards.&mdash;That there were
troubles also of another kind can be inferred from some
lines in the above-mentioned letter to Sir Charles: ‘You
terrify me by saying there is a <i>prejudice</i> against me amongst
the Catholics; what have I done? I have never been a
partizan&mdash;my voice was never heard at a meeting&mdash;I
am not a public man in the least&mdash;what <i>can</i> I have done?’
Whatever this may have reference to, the answer obviously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
would have been, that he had written <i>Melmoth</i>. Although
he had never meant to offend his Catholic townsmen, their
resentment was not altogether inexplicable, and it is certainly
curious that it should have come to him so unexpectedly.
If the Methodists had not been favourably disposed towards
him after the publication of <i>Women</i>, he now got the Catholics
against him; but as it was only the errors of both
creeds he had wished to attack, he must have suffered much
from the feeling of having, perhaps, given personal offence.&mdash;Yet
in all this dreariness there would occasionally be
outbursts of the old eccentricity and the invincible desire
sometimes to assume the rôle of a <i>grand seigneur</i>, which
he, in his harmless way, imagined best to suit him. The
following anecdote<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> has a characteristic ring about it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir Charles raised a subscription for him, amounting to fifty
pounds. The first use he made of it was to give a grand party.
There was little furniture in the reception room, but at one end
there had been erected an old theatrical property throne under
a canopy of crimson velvet, where he and Mrs. Maturin sat to receive
their visitors.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>That Maturin did not greatly care about the completion
of <i>The Universe</i> is evident from the fact that he was, so
early as 1821, engaged on a new play. In a note to Lady
Morgan he mentions that it will be acted at Hawkins’&mdash;‘the
profits will be far inferior to those of Covent Garden,
but they will be something.’ Still the play was, later on,
sent to Covent Garden, Sir Charles undertaking to use his
influence with Kean who appears, from the very first, to
have been unwilling to accept it. In a letter dated Dec. 16,
1822, Maturin writes to Sir Charles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I never felt my “lack of words” so great as at this moment when
they altogether fail me in adequately expressing my gratitude for
your kindness. Matters are not however so bad as it is <i>Elliston</i>,
not <i>Kean</i>, who has rejected the play. I have written to Kean to
beg him to read over the play <i>himself</i>, and to assure him I will acquiesce
in his judgment, whatever it be.</p>

<p>I need not say how much it would enhance my numerous obligations
to Lady Morgan were she to write to Kean merely to <i>enforce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
my request</i>, to beg he will read over the play (which he has not done)
and determine <i>for himself</i> whether it is worthy of his powers or not.</p>

<p>No decision of his can diminish my gratitude to Lady M&mdash;&mdash; and
to you.</p>
</div>

<p>Whether there was an intervention on the part of Lady
Morgan or not, the play was doomed never to see the light.
It can hardly have been any other than the one to which
Watts refers in his autobiographical notes:<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He had another tragedy in the hands of Edmund Kean, but on
this he could obtain no decision whatever. It was entitled <i>Osmyn</i>,
and is said to have been the most careful and effective of his dramatic
compositions. I made many attempts to obtain its restitution,
but in vain. On one occasion I attacked Kean before a large party,
and dwelt upon the cruel injury which Maturin had sustained from
his persistent disregard of the matter. Finally, I obtained from
him a promise that the M. S. should be forthcoming, if I could call
in Clarges Street for it on the ensuing day. This of course I did,
but was denied access to Mr. Kean, who was said to be too ill to
see me.</p>
</div>

<p>The only person who has been able to give an account
of and publish some extracts from the play is the writer
in the <i>Irish Quarterly Review</i> 1852. He states that a completed
tragedy called <i>The Siege of Salerno</i> was found among
Maturin’s manuscripts after his death, without explaining
when and how he had an opportunity of seeing it. He
states further that the plot bears, in conception, some resemblance
to Byron’s <i>Siege of Corinth</i>&mdash;the hero in both works
being, in fact, a renegade who leads Turkish forces against
a Christian town. The passage quoted in the <i>Irish Quarterly
Review</i> consists of a scene where Osmyn&mdash;the copy sent
to Kean apparently bore the name of the hero&mdash;relates
the story of his life. He has formerly been the prince of
Salerno, the very town which he now attacks as a Turkish
captain. He lived in happiness with his wife Matilda, when
suddenly his enemy</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Manfred, the terror of the neighbouring states;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plunderer of all, and tyrant of his own,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>invaded his country. Osmyn was thrown into the dungeon
of his own castle, where he was kept for years. A time
came when his prison walls were destroyed by a tempest&mdash;that
is, an earthquake&mdash;and he gained his liberty. Being
recognized by no one he wandered about in the streets and
became witness of a procession where Matilda, now the
wife of Manfred, was borne in solemn festival. In despair
he left the country:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On the last shore of Italy I kissed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A cross my mother bound about my neck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And flung it towards these towers. On Asia’s coast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I grasped the crescent.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The story, we see, is rather improbable, and the deliverance
of Osmyn from his prison belongs to the most hackneyed
tricks of the older school of terror. The hero is, however,
typically Maturineian. He is a kind of Bertram in
Ottoman costume; the one returns as a robber-chief, the
other as the leader of an infidel army, and the speech of
Osmyn is a distinct echo from Maturing first play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou would’st make man wretched, make him vile:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sear up his conscience&mdash;make his mind a desert,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His heart an ulcer, and his frame a stone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Countryless, friendless, wifeless, childless, Godless;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Accused of heaven, and hated.&mdash;Make him Osmyn.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus have they dealt with me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The writer in the <i>Irish Quarterly Review</i> assures his readers
that the play ‘abounds in passages of great power and
beauty;’ the extracts which he communicates, however,
do not rise to the level of the best pages in <i>Bertram</i> or <i>Fredolfo</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p>One more tragedy contemplated by Maturin in his last
years may yet be mentioned. A motive from the recent
history of France had been suggested to him, to which he
refers in a letter<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> of Oct. 20:th 1823:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I feel myself flattered by the reference to me contained in your
letter.&mdash;I am not disposed to think favourably of the French Tragedies
which are rather declamatory than impassioned but will do
my utmost with the subject you have sent me.</p>

<p>The allusion to Buonaparte, appears to me to constitute the
<i>forte</i> of the story, and as he is (fortunately for Europe) now dead,
I cannot think that the most inveterate Jacobin would be offended
by a representation of him on the stage to which I am convinced
Mr. Kean’s powers would give the most distinguished effect.</p>
</div>

<p>The recipient of this letter is not known, nor anything
else connected with the matter, with which all the biographers
seem to be unacquainted. Among other unfulfilled
projects is said<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> to have been a poem the scene of which
was ‘to be laid in Ireland during the period of harps and
minstrels;’ besides which Maturin wrote,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> some time before
his death, a short tale founded upon the family legend
quoted in the first chapter of the present study.</p>

<p>A determination of Maturin ‘to devote himself more
exclusively to the service of his calling’<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> led to the publication,
in 1824, of <i>Five Sermons on the Errors of the Roman
Catholic Church</i>. These controversial sermons were preached
during the Lent of the same year before an audience unparalleled
in number. ‘Never since Dean Kirwan’s time,’
it is stated in a contemporary memoir,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> ‘were such crowds
attracted to the Parish Church as during the delivery of
these sermons; neither rain nor storm could subdue the
anxiety of all classes and all persuasions to hear them.’
The sermons are explicitly said to be directed, not against
Catholics, but Catholicism; Maturin endeavoured earnestly
to avoid a tone of personal offensiveness, although it is much
to be questioned whether he did not, in the following passage,
underrate the attachment of the Irish Catholics to
their faith:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I will add, that of all the Protestant Ministers in Dublin, I have
happened to have the most extensive and intimate intercourse with
Roman Catholics, and that I have found many of them so truly
amiable and excellent, that I could heartily have wished myself,
and all I loved, to be “almost and altogether like unto them, <i>except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
their bonds</i>”&mdash;but amongst all of them I have remarked such an
obvious, though tacit admission, of the errors of their Church&mdash;such
an earnest wish for scriptural instruction and mental enlargement&mdash;such
a desire for the only true <i>Catholic Emancipation</i>, the
emancipation of the intellect and the conscience, that though I would
have felt it unfit to turn the stream of social conversation into the
channel of controversy, I did most anxiously wish for an opportunity
of pointing out to them in a public address, those errors of which
they themselves appeared so deeply conscious.</p>
</div>

<p>The volume was received very favourably and reprinted
in 1826.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In autumn 1824 appeared the last of Maturin’s lucubrations,
a historical novel called <i>The Albigenses</i>. Though of
imposing length&mdash;four volumes, together about 1500 pages&mdash;it
was intended to be but the first series of a great trilogy,
‘illustrative,’ as stated in the preface, ‘of European feelings
and manners in ancient times, in middle, and in modern.’
How the second and third parts had been planned is thus
described:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The more subtle policy, improved system of government, and
commencing diffusion of literature in the second period,&mdash;and the
still more enlightened political system, confirmed knowledge, and
popular influence, that distinguish times nearer to our own,&mdash;give
obvious room for all that is picturesque, intelligent, and interesting
in description.</p>
</div>

<p>There is little doubt that Maturin was induced to turn to
the historical romance by the immense popularity of Scott,
whose fame now stood at its zenith. He knew that this
<i>genre</i>, at any rate, would not be objected to as obsolete or
offensive to good feeling, as had been the case with his previous
work. An outward success, moreover, was now more
imperative than ever before, and everything could be hoped
from the public rage for historical novels. This field of
fiction was entirely new to Maturin; in <i>The Lovers’ Tale</i>
only the general ‘atmosphere’ is historical&mdash;the incidents
might have taken place in any age. The experiment, if
praiseworthy, was decidedly hazardous; to outdo Mrs. Radcliffe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
and Lewis had been easy enough, but to enter into
competition with the Author of <i>Waverley</i> was a serious
matter for a writer whose powers lay in depicting what
was passing before his own eyes, or else, what never could
have happened at all. That most contemporary critics
nevertheless hailed <i>The Albigenses</i> as Maturin’s best work
only proves their partiality for the style in which it was
written; of later judges even his greatest admirer admits
that Maturin’s attempt to ‘marry history to fiction’ turned
out a failure.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The action of the story commences in 1216, at a time
when the forces of the Albigenses are threatening the castle
of Courtenaye. The sect is alternately headed and abandoned
by count Raymond of Toulouse, who, though Catholic
himself, occasionally wishes to save his vassals from complete
destruction. His present designs are unknown; he has
travelled to Rome to seek reconciliation with the Pope,
and is expected back at any hour. In the meantime the
persecuted Albigenses live in great misery among the mountains
of Languedoc. Their leader is an old and venerable
pastor of the name of Pierre, whom the cruelty of the crusaders
has deprived of sight. He is tended by his granddaughter
Genevieve, as good and gentle a being as himself,
and constantly exhorts his followers to mildness and forgiveness;
in this he is fiercely opposed by a fraction of wild
fanatics, represented, among others, by the deacon Mephibosheth,
a man of ‘intolerant zeal, and intolerable pretentions,’
who subsequently turns renegade.&mdash;The lord of
Courtenaye, a savage and cowardly cripple, who fears the
vicinity of the Albigenses but is unable to defend himself,
summons the chief crusaders to his aid. The summons is
very willingly obeyed, and a great army of knights and
crusaders is, at the opening of the tale, marching towards
the castle. The most eminent leaders of the Catholic forces
are count Simon de Montfort, the ‘champion of the church,’
a rude and powerful soldier&mdash;and the bishop of Toulouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
a vigorous-minded sceptic, who in everything pursues his
own advantage and aims at the increase of his own influence,
‘a man of power and might, body and soul, whose strong
mind clung to his strong frame like the human part of the
centaur of old to the animal part, making but <i>one</i> between
them.’ There is a great deal of jealousy between these two
warriors, and their army is split with discord and mutual
suspicion. The majority are for attacking the heretics at
once and crushing them at a single blow, while others
advise waiting till the result of count Raymond’s negotiations
with the Pope is known. From a message brought to the
bishop it appears that the court of Rome has sent a monk
of uncommon sanctity to mediate between the two hostile
armies; the mediator has already visited the Albigenses
and is now on his way to the castle. This simple and honest
monk, who is chosen by the Pope with a view to ‘diminish
the power and mortify the ambition’ of the bishop of Toulouse,
has been received with hostility by the zealous fraction
among the Albigenses, and only after great exertions
on the part of Pierre has the arrangement been brought
about that they consent to hear an exhortation from the
bishop, on a promise of safety. The day being fixed,
the crusaders set out with pomp and splendour to the
meeting-place. The bishop delivers a magnificent sermon,
but without effect; the Albigeois preachers reply with
spirit, and reconciliation is found impossible. They are to
resort to arms the following day. The crusaders retire to
the castle of Courtenaye; the night is spent in carousals,
during which De Montfort proposes that he and the
knights alone would ride the heretics down; the proposal is
eagerly accepted, in spite of the warnings of an old knight
called Sir Aymer de Chastelroi.&mdash;The Albigenses are prepared
for the worst, but the same night count Raymond
returns with a great army. Besides the political, he has
a personal cause against the crusaders: the late lord Courtenaye,
the brother of the present one, has once surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
his castle and slaughtered his wife and children, for which
outrage he has sworn eternal vengeance. He now takes
command of the Albigenses; it is decided to wait till the
crusaders are enclosed in a valley, and then beset them
from all sides. The stratagem is easily carried out, and
the knights are completely defeated. De Montfort is wounded
almost to death, while the bishop succeeds in making
his way out of the ambuscade, and arrives at the castle
with a few surviving knights. De Montfort also is afterwards
brought to the castle, where he slowly recovers.&mdash;Count
Raymond, understanding that his victory is entirely
due to the temerity of the vanquished, commands the whole
band of the Albigenses to set out for the kingdom of Arragon,
whither, indeed, it is the bishop’s intention immediately
to pursue them. De Montfort being disabled for a long
time, the bishop assumes the title of the champion of the
church and places himself at the head of the crusading army.
His enterprise, however, meets various difficulties; the followers
of the knights who have perished in the recent battle
begin to desert, when no longer commanded by their individual
leaders, besides which king Philip refuses to recognize
the bishop as the champion of the Church, before the title
is admitted by the Pope. Under these circumstances the
bishop proceeds to lead his forces to his own castle in the
city of Beaucaire. On the road he lights upon a veiled lady
who travels with one single attendant and turns out to be
no less a person than queen Ingelberg. King Philip, being
violently in love with Agnes of Moravia, has deserted the
queen and even planned against her life, for which reason
she tries to escape to her brother the king of Denmark.
The bishop at once resolves to carry her as a prisoner to
his castle; he is anxious to preserve the life of the queen,
in order to be able to annul the king’s adulterous marriage,
should he deny him future aid.&mdash;The queen subsequently
makes her escape and is reconciled to the king.&mdash;A new
crusade is soon determined upon, and the bishop, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
great number of nobles and dignitaries whom he has won
to his side, marches to Nismes, which is this time fixed as
meeting-place for the Catholic leaders. Among these is
prince Lewis, who is very desirous to take the lead, and
hates the bishop as cordially as he hates De Montfort. The
latter has not yet recovered his strength, but shows no
inclination to resign his title, and thus the old discord again
prevails in the crusading army:&mdash;The Albigenses have once
more been abandoned by the vacillating count Raymond,
but some others of the most potent lords of Languedoc
have taken up arms in their cause, and entrenched themselves
in Tarascon. The crusaders now march against that
city, outside whose walls a long and furious battle is fought.
De Montfort, weakened by his illness, falls; still the issue
of the battle would be uncertain, should not count Raymond
again arrive at the critical moment. The crusaders, indeed,
seize the castle of Tarascon, but their army is defeated by
count Raymond, who pitches his camp in the vicinity. The
next day he makes a new attack and easily occupies the
town. The Albigenses triumph once more.&mdash;</p>

<p>These two battles form the historical framework, around
which is woven the romantic plot of the story, intricate
and duly based on chivalry and love. The principal hero
is a youthful knight called Sir Paladour de la Croix Sanglante,
who, at the very end, is discovered to be the son of
count Raymond of Toulouse. He has been saved at the
general slaughter of the count’s family, is brought up in
obscurity, but knighted by the king after a siege in which
he has distinguished himself. The only person who knows
of his descent is an old, half-crazy woman, who has seen
better days. She was, in fact, once a rich and beautiful
lady of the name of Marie de Mortemar; being accused of
heresy, she was attacked by count Raymond, the late brother
of the lord of Courtenaye, and the bishop of Toulouse,
who ‘despoiled her of lands and power, and burnt her castles,
and made of her people serfs, and misused her in such sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
that she wandered a maniac for a time, and then was heard
of no more.’ The ill-usage she has undergone has so changed
her that she is recognized by no one, yet she pursues, with
relentlessness and dexterity, a scheme of vengeance against
her former persecutors. The late lord of Courtenaye, who
afterwards became the enemy of count Raymond, is suspected
to have been murdered at the instigation of his brother
the present lord; but Marie de Mortemar is intent
upon the destruction of the whole house of Courtenaye.
This destruction is to be executed by the hand of Sir Paladour,
whose fortunes she continually follows. When he is
hastening, in the first chapter of the book, to join the crusading
army, she guides him over a lake and directs him
towards the castle of Courtenaye. She lives, for the most
part, in the vaults of this castle, where she is, in association
with a few other hags, occupied in all sorts of dark and
necromantic pursuits, ostensibly in the service of the superstitious
lord, but secretly meditating his ruin.&mdash;At the
castle resides also lady Isabelle, the daughter of the late
lord of Courtenaye; she and Paladour fall in love at first
sight. He hardly dares to address her, though energetically
urged thereto by the merry Sir Aymer de Chastelroi&mdash;but
before long he has opportunity of rendering her an essential
service. On arriving at the castle, count Simon de Montfort
informs Isabelle that king Philip, whose ward she is,
has promised her hand to a man whom she is very unwilling
to accept. Her despair at last touches even De Montfort;
he hints that there may be found a way of extricating her
from the matter&mdash;namely, if some champion of hers can
unhorse him, ‘or draw blood from between the joints of his
harness.’ Paladour at once accepts the challenge, and really
overthrows the dreaded warrior. After this he is regarded
as the avowed champion of the lady Isabelle, and takes
but little notice of his rivals, two very foolish knights called
de Verac and de Semonville.&mdash;The great battle that ends
so unfortunately for the crusaders is watched by Isabelle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
from an adjacent hill. When the defeat becomes evident
she starts, with her maidens, at full speed for the castle.
Suddenly she is accosted by a knight in black armour, who
says he has a message from Sir Paladour, and offers to conduct
the party by a secret path, the main road to the castle
being intercepted by the heretics. While still speaking, the
knight seizes her rein and gallops along. After a while they
are joined by men in vizards, and the ride finally terminates
at the coast of the Mediterranean. The frightened females
are conveyed to a small isle where there stands the impregnable
castle of a bold outlaw, the terror of all the neighbourhood.&mdash;Sir
Paladour is among the knights who survive
the battle; when told of the disappearance of Isabelle, he
immediately sets out in quest of her. On a dark heath he
meets his mysterious guide, the maniac woman, who informs
him where Isabelle is taken and points out to him the distant
tower of the outlaw’s castle. He follows the direction,
and at the very moment he is approaching, a party of pilgrims
passing along the coast is attacked by the robbers.
Paladour rushes to their aid, but is severely wounded, and
dragged to the castle as a prisoner.&mdash;Isabelle is, at first,
treated with a kind of rude courtesy; the outlaw has seized
her in hopes of a large ransom, but struck by her beauty
he soon begins to make love to her, and, being rejected,
assumes a threatening tone. As for Paladour, but little heed
is taken of him, and he is left to recover from his wounds
as best he can. He is much worried by a raging lycanthrope
living in the vaults; once the latter assaults him while he
is sleeping, and only by exerting his utmost strength can
Paladour knock him down. In his last moments, however,
the lycanthrope regains his reason and shows Paladour a
secret passage leading to the terrace at the sea, from where
he can hold converse with the lady. When it is discovered
that he is the lover and champion of Isabelle, their situation
becomes extremely precarious; but one night, when the
terrace happens to be deserted, Isabelle and her maidens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
manage to descend from their window to the terrace. Here
they are received by Paladour, and the whole party sets
out in a boat. Their flight is soon discovered; the outlaw,
pursuing them in another boat, reaches them as they
touch the shore. At the moment when he is about to stab
Paladour, a dark figure rushes between and plunges a dagger
in the outlaw’s heart: it is again the maniac woman, Marie
de Mortemar. Taking Paladour aside she reminds him of
a vow he has made, as a child, to sacrifice the last survivor
of his enemy’s race. Paladour is still ignorant who his
enemies are, but the woman promises to let him know in
due time. Without further adventure the party then arrives
at the castle. The lord of Courtenaye is not delighted;
his state and wealth depend on Isabelle’s continuing unmarried,
and he has secretly hoped, that both she and her
bridegroom would perish. He cannot avoid celebrating
their nuptials with a grand feast, but contemplates all the
time means for their destruction; calling the maniac woman
to his presence he declares himself ready to enter an alliance
with the devil, whom he, in his superstition, believes
her able to conjure. She answers with mysterious threats,
having decided in the bridal night to wreak her vengeance
on the house of Courtenaye. The night comes, and as it
grows late the lord retires into his secret chamber among
the vaults, where the other hags are awaiting their leader.
Through their imprudence the chamber catches fire, and
the lord of Courtenaye who, in a fit of impatient rage, has
thrown the key in a cauldron, perishes with his attendants.
At the same time the news spreads in the castle that the
bride has been murdered and the bridegroom has disappeared.
The maniac has now informed Paladour that
his destined victim is no other than his bride. He conceives
that the only way of escaping the fulfilment of his vow is
to stab himself; Isabelle, thinking him mad, tries to prevent
him, and during the grapple the dagger is plunged
into her breast. Paladour rushes away half-deranged and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
runs till he falls down exhausted, being then taken care of
by the maniac, who at last relents towards him. She dresses
up Isabelle&mdash;whose wound is not mortal&mdash;as a page and
gives her to Paladour; in this capacity she follows him
without daring to reveal herself so long as his reason is
not quite restored.&mdash;Being indifferent to everything and
seeking only death, he joins the count’s army as a mysterious
‘black knight,’ unknown to all. After the victory
of Tarascon his relationship to count Raymond is discovered
with the help of a monk; on the same occasion Isabelle
reveals her identity, and they are happily re-united.&mdash;</p>

<p>The story, however, contains yet another love-intrigue.
Paladour has a younger brother of the name of Sir Amirald,
who also appears to have been saved from the massacre.
He is brought up at the castle of Courtenaye and very badly
used by its lord. When Paladour and Amirald meet in the
crusading army, a close friendship springs up between them,
and they find, to their wonder, that they bear a similar
mark on the shoulder. Amirald has seen Genevieve, the
granddaughter of the old Albigeois pastor, and fallen in
love with her. Once when he is wandering in the vicinity
of the castle, he is roused by cries for help; they proceed
from Genevieve, whom two robbers are carrying away,
deeming her ‘no unacceptable prize’ to the crusaders. Amirald
overcomes the ruffians and accompanies Genevieve to
the Albigenses. In the first great battle a stone from a
sling smites him down; as the Albigenses move on, Genevieve
stumbles over his body. She recognises her preserver
and, perceiving there is life, removes him into a cave, with
the reluctant assistance of an unsuccessful lover of hers,
a young man called Amand. She then visits Amirald regularly
and tends him till he is restored to health. When
count Raymond commands the Albigenses to move still farther
into the mountains, Amand demands her promise to abandon
Amirald; on her refusing, he in jealousy informs the
chiefs of the sect that Genevieve has saved the life of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
enemy, with the result that she is banished from the community.
Two men are sent to convey her to Toulouse,
but, having lost their way, they both perish, and Genevieve
herself is, in a senseless state, carried into a convent by
some monks who chance to find her. Yet when she is discovered
to be a heretic, she is instantly expelled. Pursuing
her way alone, she is now seized by the same ruffians from
whom Amirald had rescued her. They drag her into the
abbey of Normoutier where she falls into the hands of the
bishop of Toulouse and is taken with his party to Beaucaire.
Here she is sumptuously clad and treated with mildness,
the bishop’s intention being to make her his mistress; but
she firmly resists his temptations. Subsequently she succeeds
not only in escaping but in effecting the escape of
the queen, whose life she saves at the risk of her own, thus
earning her gratitude and protection. They travel onward
with a party of knights who have been in quest of the queen
in order to bring her back to the king, he being now willing to
receive her as his spouse again. Among the knights is Amirald,
who openly avows his love to Genevieve. He is commissioned
to conduct her to Toulouse, but this time their journey
is intercepted by the army of prince Lewis. He also is
enraptured by the beauty of Genevieve and compells her
to follow him to Nismes, where the new crusade is being
prepared. Being told by Genevieve that she has saved
the life of his mother, the prince promises to protect her
from every injury, yet determines to keep her for himself
and refuses to surrender her to Amirald. The bishop, however,
who is filled with a deadly hatred against her, urges
that she be delivered into the hands of justice, to be condemned
to death as a heretic. When the prince tries to
protect her a riot breaks out&mdash;the house where she is kept
is burnt down, but at the last moment Amirald saves her
and they escape to Tarascon where he, now turned an Albigeois,
joins the army of the lords of Languedoc. In the
battle of Tarascon, Amirald and Genevieve are among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
a party of Albigenses who remain captives in the town. All
prisoners are, at the command of the bishop, to be burnt
alive; they are already bound at the stake when the army
of count Raymond rushes into Tarascon. Paladour, remembering
the mark on their shoulders, immediately hastens
to liberate his brother.&mdash;At the same time the bishop
falls a victim to the vengeance of Marie de Mortemar. She
has also been brought to the city as a prisoner, and being
kept in custody in a solitary chamber near the chapel, she
manages to poison the holy water a moment before the
bishop celebrates the mass. He rushes into his room where
he applies strong antidotes, all in vain. Suspecting the
maniac he calls her to his presence; she reveals herself as
Marie de Mortemar, declaring the aim of her life to be fulfilled:
while the bishop is expiring, she throws herself out
of the casement and is dashed to pieces.&mdash;The heroes and
heroines live in happiness ever afterwards; ‘The difference
of birth and creed was never known to disturb the affection
that subsisted between the high-born Lady of Courtenaye
and the humble bride of Amirald.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Considering the inordinate length of <i>The Albigenses</i>, it
must be admitted that the story is fairly well constructed,
and the rich materials&mdash;although of little originality&mdash;not
unskilfully arranged. In this respect there certainly
can be detected a sort of improvement on Maturin’s earlier
romances; but it is a very poor compensation for the loss
of their peculiar charm in style and description. In <i>The
Albigenses</i> there is hardly a page which could not have
been written by somebody else; the personal note in the
diction, the keenness of psychological insight, and the characteristic
boldness of imagination which distinguished <i>Women</i>
and <i>Melmoth</i>, and even <i>The Milesian Chief</i>, have completely
disappeared. And this change, it is painful to
observe, has been brought about by the attacks of injudicious
reviewers, as clearly stated in the preface:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How far I may have succeeded, is not for me to judge. I put
forwards my present work with diffidence. No one can think more
moderately of his powers than I do of mine; but I must demand
of my reader’s consideration, that the opinions and errors of my
imaginary characters shall not be transferred to my own. In what
singularly severe and injurious spirit this has been hitherto done,
I need not say. No man less disregards public opinion; no man is
less disposed to offer an insolent defiance to sincere criticism: but
if an unoffending life cannot protect a writer from those dangerous
imputations, I disdain defence, and leave them to their judgment
by all generous and unprejudiced minds.</p>
</div>

<p>Maturin’s journey to Canossa was graciously acknowledged
by all critics except one. In the newly established
<i>Westminster Review</i><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> there appeared an uncommonly intelligent
and well-written article, showing an understanding
of Maturin and a penetration into his talent, which far
surpasses that of all other contemporary critics. To the
general verdict of this unknown writer on <i>The Albigenses</i>
nothing could be added, nor can its rightfulness be questioned
by any one acquainted with Maturin’s works:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are a little disappointed in finding that Mr. Maturin’s new
work is not of a character that either entitles or entices us to make
it the occasion of a general examination of his literary pretensions.
For we could not do this effectually, without adducing various examples
of the faults and the good qualities that are peculiar to his writings;
and it so happens, that the work now before us is almost
entirely deficient in either of these. It is, perhaps, not very difficult
to account for this. Mr. Maturin, though now a tolerably practised
writer, is far from having acquired that command over the efforts
of his pen which the time that he has exercised it would, under
ordinary circumstances, have given him: for his mind is not one
that will submit to be “constrained by mastery,” either in its strengths
or its weaknesses. It may be <i>led</i>, we sincerely believe, to perform
very valuable services to the republic of letters; but it may not be
<i>driven</i> to do either good or evil. And if it <i>be</i> driven, the results will
be a something between the two, and bearing no distinctive character
whatever. Now, we conceive the work before us to have proceeded
from an artificial and ill-considered impetus of the above kind.
Mr. Maturin has publicly stated, as an excuse (<i>that</i> is the form under
which he most unnecessarily puts it) for writing Romances at all,
that his necessities oblige him to do so; and yet all the Romances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
he has hitherto written have subjected him to the most virulent
abuse from several of those critical tribunals, on whose fiat the
popularity of works of this class mainly depends&mdash;or, at all events,
by which that popularity can be greatly advanced, and still more
greatly retarded. And this abuse, too, when it has descended to
detail, has, in almost every instance, been levelled at precisely those
portions of the work in question in which the author must have felt,
and every one else must have admitted, that the beauties, if beauties
the work contained, were to be found. What could a writer, but
little acquainted with the nature of his own powers, and avowedly
employing them with a view to present distinction, be expected to
do under such circumstances, but resolutely set himself to avoid
the errors that seemed to lay in the way of his object? And in doing
so, what could be expected as the first result of this effort, but what
we, in fact, meet with in the work, the title of which stands at the
head of this paper?&mdash;namely, a production in which all the most
glaring faults that existed in his previous ones are in a great degree
absent; and in which all the beauties which more than redeemed
those faults, are absent too. The truth is, Mr. Maturin did not seek
instruction from the right source. Instead of feeling contempt for
those who expressed a contempt which they did <i>not</i> feel towards
him, he flew to <i>them</i> for that counsel which he should have taken
of his own good sense, and his own heart.</p>
</div>

<p>That Maturin did not take counsel of his own heart
means that he wrote without inspiration; and that is why
the adventures and hair-breadth escapes fail to excite, and
the characters appear so hopelessly conventional. The characterization
is, in fact, the weakest side of <i>The Albigenses</i>,
and that of the principal personages the least worthy of
Maturin’s powers. Paladour and Amirald simply possess
every chivalrous virtue imaginable, neither being subject
to any faults whatsoever, nor is there one single individual
trait to distinguish them from others. The description of
these two paragons is pervaded by a deadly seriousness and
an unbroken solemnity, all the more causeless as both are
destined to become perfectly happy in the end. The influence
of Scott, which otherwise is perceptible throughout
the story, in no instance extends itself to the treatment of
the heroes. The different methods of the two novelists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
can be compared in the openings of <i>The Albigenses</i> and
<i>Quentin Durward</i> (1823). Both works begin with a brief
account of the state of France in the respective periods&mdash;after
which the heroes are introduced as solitary travellers
and knight-errants. Quentin Durward, a merry light-hearted
youth, appears on a bright summer morning, carelessly
joining company with the first people he encounters, committing
various indiscretions, being on the point of getting
hanged, and going through it all with imperturbable good-humour.
Paladour travels through an autumnal night,
engaged in sombre thoughts, recollections and anticipations,
meeting beings unearthly and mysterious and preserving
all the time the same sepulchral gravity. The one way, of
course, can in itself be as good as the other, and the beginning
of <i>The Albigenses</i> is not without merit; but as the story
advances it would not be out of the place to make a counterpoise
to this lugubrious hero in the person of the younger
Sir Amirald. Yet he is but a repetition of his brother, as
grave and as blameless. There is nothing of the contrast so
finely brought forth in <i>Montorio</i> between Hippolito and
Annibal, and in <i>The Milesian Chief</i> between Connal and
Desmond: Amirald, no more than Paladour, does anything
rash or thoughtless; they never laugh; they are never even
present in comical situations. Now one of the secrets of the
perennial freshness of the <i>Waverley</i> novels is a manner
the author has of ‘dealing sly digs at his own stateliest heroes.’<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
He never takes them too seriously; he exposes
their human weaknesses with obvious satisfaction, and
finally allows them to be united with their lady-loves much
because he does not think them worth writing tragedies
about. This method being extremely foreign to Maturin,
his surest way of succeeding with his heroes is to make
them really tragic and treat them with the terrible pathos
and passionate sympathy which breathes from the pages of
<i>The Milesian Chief</i>. In <i>The Albigenses</i> neither condition is
fulfilled, and the personages, consequently, do not live.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
The same is equally true of the heroines; there are no traces
of the psychological mastery which had created Eva
and Immalee. Isabelle and Genevieve are as superlative
with regard to exalted qualities as are their lovers: the
former, being a high-born lady, is supplied with a just
amount of pride, while the latter, as suits her station, is all
humbleness and self-denial. How horribly fustian and
melodramatic the description occasionally becomes, can be
seen from the scene where the outlaw, whose prisoner Isabelle
is, makes her a proposal of marriage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Isabelle sprang on her feet&mdash;both hands were compressed on
her left bosom, as if <i>expecting</i> her heart would burst, and her eyes
inflamed and dilated seemed starting from their sockets. She
directed them right onward for some moments, as if they could
have pierced her prison-walls; at length she turned them full on
the outlaw and that look said as audibly as language, “Begone this
moment, or stay and see me driven to frenzy!”</p>
</div>

<p>The comic figures in the story&mdash;most of whom are
invariably comic&mdash;are hardly less stereotyped and without
charm. An exception must be made for the well-drawn
Sir Aymer, an old knight who continually affects a tone
of youthful gallantry but is, at bottom, a man of honour
and delicacy. The drunken abbot of Normoutier with his
eternal mal-a-prop Latin quotations, and the foppish Sir
Ezzelin de Verac, are, on the other hand, very heavy
and tiresome. The best drawn character in <i>The Albigenses</i>
is the bishop of Toulouse. There is something truly imposing
in his ambitious schemes, and his scepticism and clear-headedness
form a salutary contrast to the superstitious
fanaticism of his fellow-crusaders. The speech with which
he tries to dazzle and seduce the inexperienced Genevieve,
while she is his prisoner in Beaucaire, is one of the most
eloquent passages in the book, and shows once more what
Maturin was capable of achieving on his favourite topic,
the unlimited power and the soul-destroying influence of
the Catholic church:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>The vast system of which I am no feeble or inert engine, hastens
to the summation of its working&mdash;the conquest of the world. That
old and mighty Rome, of whom pedants prate, subdued but the
meaner part of man&mdash;his body; but our Rome enslaves the mind&mdash;that
mind, which, once enslaved, leaves nothing for opposition
or for defeat. Look round thee&mdash;a peevish dotard in the seven-throned
palace tramples with his palsied foot on the necks of the
crowned kings of earth, from the shores of the Orcades to the cliffs
of Calpe. He stamps with it, and their blood, their treasures, and
their vassals are poured on Asia, making the eastern world tremble
to its centre: for ours is the power that not only binds the spirit
but makes it clasp its chain; ours are the powers of the world to
come; all that is potent in life, all that is mysterious in futurity,
the fears, the hopes, the hearts of mankind, all are ours; and shall
we not wield the weapon their credulity has put into our hands for
our own behoof? &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; All knowledge is ours&mdash;to the laity the
book is closed&mdash;the key is lost&mdash;every avenue to science, every
loophole through which light might wander, is barred up or sternly
sentinelled; the tomes of ancient wisdom are buried in monkish
libraries, unfolded, save by daring hands like mine. Under the old
tyrants of the earth the decree of a senate might desolate a province,
and the frolic of an emperor consume a city; but when did it chain
up the arm of man, or wither his soul within him, like a papal interdict,
at whose reported sound the bridegroom drops the hand of the
betrothed, the mourner quits the unburied corse, and the priest
flies from the altar? I tell thee, maiden, the eagles of Ancient Rome
would be blasted if they dared to grasp the thunder that is now
wielded by the hand of every busy legate.</p>
</div>

<p>The best things in <i>The Albigenses</i> are to be found in
certain vividly narrated episodes and brilliant descriptions,
which are quite other than the hackneyed adventures of
the actual <i>dramatis personæ</i>. Among them is the story
of the heretic deacon Mephibosheth. He is taken, by some
Catholic travellers, to the abbey of Normoutier, where the
monks, in the absence of the abbot, have elected an ‘abbot
of misrule’ and arranged a carousal on a large scale. The
deacon is compelled to become one of the company and
take part in a wild dance; he first refuses, but then, being
sufficiently drunk, he for a while becomes the jolliest of
them all, until his feelings as suddenly reverse themselves
and he starts smashing costly windows and figures of saints.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
The monks decide to hang him, but the cord breaks, and he
is finally spared on condition of procuring them a beautiful
heretic damsel. The deacon, remembering Genevieve, readily
complies, but she is brought there by the two robbers
before he has time to fulfil his promise. The deacon, however,
remains at the abbey and, having turned Catholic,
becomes a follower of the bishop and is, at last, hanged in
good earnest by the men of count Raymond, after the battle
of Tarascon. The feast of the abbot of misrule, which presents
a phase of monastic life seldom described,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> is depicted
with superabundant vivacity and humour, and in a true
mediaeval spirit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash; &mdash; “Surely I will not dance,” quoth the deacon, whose courage
rose with opposition; “it is an abomination more befitting the daughter
of the harlot Herodias than a deacon of the holy congregation.
All dancing is evil, exceedingly evil, and not good&mdash;but to dance
in the tents of Kedar and the tabernacles of the idolaters, to be
set up on high among the ungodly, and dance in the high places,
were an utter abomination:&mdash;wherefore I say, Down with the filthy
squeaking of pipes, and the lewd jarring of crowds, and&mdash;” “So
please you, my lord abbot,” said one of the monks, “let us drown
this peevish fellow’s noise, and cause him to dance with us:&mdash;your
true sour heretic (and your lordship perceives he is no better, though
I shame to name such vermin before your lordship) needs no other
martyrdom than the sight of free honest mirth.”&mdash;“Thou sayest
well,” said the abbot; “he shall dance and die the death of the spleenful:
for the rest, let such of the nine worthies as be sober, lead forth
Deborah, Judith, and Queen Dido&mdash;the three children in the furnace
shall dance with Nebuchadnezzar to make up their old grudge&mdash;Susanna
shall pace with one of the elders, and the goddess of
Chastity with the other&mdash;ourself, the Abbot of Misrule, will lead
the lady of loose-delight, with her paintings and her pouncings,
her mincings and her mockings&mdash;and the heretic shall dance with
the devil, and there is a company meetly sorted. Strike up, my
masters.”&mdash;Here the hapless Mephibosheth was seized on by a hideous
figure enveloped in a black garment, with cloven feet of flame
colour, a tail that swept the ground, a mask equipped with “eyes
that glow and fangs that grin,” and a huge pair of horns starting
from the forehead. All his struggles availed nothing with his frightful
partner: he was dragged into the circle, compelled to perform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
numerous pirouettes, which were more remarkable for velocity
than grace, and if he relaxed for a moment in his exertions, a swinge
of his partner’s tail, a kick of his cloven foot, or a blow with his
horns, set him prancing again with pain and terror till his strength
was exhausted, and he fell to the ground. At this moment the
cook was seen entering the hall, attended by the lay-brothers groaning
under the heavy dishes they bore, and shouting in unison the
monastic chorus&mdash;</p>

<p>A fine chapter is also one describing a night at the castle
of Courtenaye before the first battle. A frightful tempest
is raging, and most of the guests have retired; at last only
a few of the chief crusaders are sitting in the dimly illuminated
hall, passing their time in telling ghost-stories. Sir Aymer,
in his humorous way, relates an adventure which happened
to his uncle, whereupon De Montfort tells a very dismal
one which happened to himself, as he once beheld the ghosts
of a large congregation of Albigenses whom he had slaughtered
some ten years before. The right note is here struck
by simple means, and the uncomfortable sensations of the
superstitious company are skilfully transferred to the reader.&mdash;Scenes
like these are, no doubt, filled with the real spirit
of the time in question; but as a historical novel in the
usual sense of the word <i>The Albigenses</i> has no great claims
to distinction. The historical facts which underlie the plot
are but meagre, and, moreover, treated with considerable
freedom. Imagination often makes up for accurate information.
Even one of those critics<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> who admired <i>The Albigenses</i>
as a romance, thinks the author deficient in a ‘minute
and extensive acquaintance with the antiquities of
the middle ages,’ declaring his descriptions to be of a cast
that ‘may be executed by any one moderately read in Froissart,
and tolerably conversant with the less recondite sources<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
of information contained in the common English and
German romances.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The picture of the merry life led in the abbey of Normoutier
strikes one by its perfect novelty in Maturin’s work,
nor are there, in <i>The Albigenses</i>, any instances of ecclesiastical
cruelty or monastic oppression; the monks are, upon
the whole, no worse than other people. Nevertheless the
Radcliffe school reappears in some of the adventures of
the heroines, especially in the escape of Isabelle from the
clutches of the outlaw, and that of Genevieve from the
palace of the bishop of Toulouse. The secret passages, happily
detected at the right moment, the inevitable subterranean
vaults and concealed doors have their origin in that
style of fiction which Maturin now had disavowed. The
design of Marie de Mortemar to have her vengeance on the
last survivor of the house of Courtenaye executed by the
hand of Sir Paladour, leads back to the idea upon which
<i>Montorio</i> is founded. Otherwise <i>The Albigenses</i> is but too
clearly modelled on Scott; most of the characters have
their prototypes in the <i>Waverley</i> novels, and a great many
of the situations likewise bear a resemblance to the same
distinguished patterns. <i>Quentin Durward</i>, <i>Old Mortality</i>
(1817), <i>Ivanhoe</i> (1820), <i>The Monastery</i> (1820) and others
are constantly called to mind, all the comparisons being to
the disadvantage of <i>The Albigenses</i>. To mention some
of the most conspicuous likenesses, count Simon de Montfort
has a counterpart in duke Charles of Burgundy in
<i>Quentin Durward</i>; both are men of a fierce and uncontrollable
temper and unrefined habits, accustomed only to consult
their own will and pleasure. Duke Charles has the
same message to Isabelle of Croye as De Montfort to Isabelle
of Courtenaye, namely, of a marriage which appears
to be against the inclinations of the heroines, and the language
of these powerful lords, when contradicted, is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
offensive to a young lady of rank. Duke Charles threatens
to drag the lady to the altar with his own hands, contemptuously
speaking of her ‘baby face,’ while De Montfort, in
the corresponding scene, flies out against Isabelle, calling
her a ‘gaudy, delicate, disdainful toy.’ At last the matter
is, in both cases, referred to the skill and valour of the champions
of the fair ones.&mdash;The capture of Isabelle by the
outlaw resembles much the seizure of Rowena, in <i>Ivanhoe</i>,
by Reginald Front-de-Boef. Both prisoners are, as a token
of respect, shown into the best rooms; ‘the apartment to
which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was fitted up
with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence,
and her being placed there might be considered as a peculiar
mark of respect not offered to the other prisoners. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; The
tapestry hung down from the walls in many places,
and in others was tarnished and faded under the effects
of the sun, or tattered and decayed by age.’ Maturin’s description
of the chamber of Isabelle is exactly similar: ‘It
was to this apartment the lady Isabelle ascended, and it
was evident that it had been furnished with a kind of rude
and hasty splendour. Tapestry was hung on the walls by
wooden pegs stuck between the interstices of the stones, but
in many places those walls of ragged stone were totally
bare.’ Then the ladies are the object of love-making by
persons odious to them, while their real lovers lie prisoners
in the same castles. Rebecca, in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, obviously served
as a model to Genevieve. Their goodness and mildness is
the same, and the one, being the daughter of a Jew, as well
as the other being a heretic, is in a defenceless and dangerous
position. The speech of the templar to Rebecca, when
he persuades her to fly with him to the Orient and become
a partner in his bold plans has, no doubt, influenced the
speech which the bishop makes to Genevieve, quoted above:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Templar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his power
of free agency, but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty
body, before which thrones already tremble,&mdash;even as the single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
drop of rain which mixes with the sea becomes an individual part of
that resistless ocean, which undermines rocks and engulfs royal
armadas. Such a swelling flood is that powerful league. Of this
mighty Order I am no mean member, but already one of the Chief
Commanders, and may well aspire one day to hold the batoon of
Grand Master. The poor soldiers of the Temple will not alone place
their foot upon the necks of kings&mdash;a hempsandall’d monk can do
that. Our mailed step shall ascend their throne&mdash;our gauntlet
shall wrench the sceptre from their gripe. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The likeness of the bishop to the templar is, however,
but slight; the latter is a fantast, with nothing of the cold
deliberateness of the former.&mdash;In the abbot of Normoutier
critics believed they recognized the prior of Jorvault. Neither
is, indeed, over-eager in discharging his sacerdotal
duties, yet the prior is a man of the world, while the abbot
is a coarse boar and never would have wit enough to compose
a letter like that sent by the prior to the templar&mdash;however
heartily he would approve of the contents.&mdash;Sir Ezzelin
de Verac would scarcely have been born but for the
existence of Sir Piercie Shafton in <i>The Monastery</i>; but of
all imitations in <i>The Albigenses</i> he is the least successful.
His only interest is the state of his wardrobe, and his only
accomplishment to dress fashionably, while Sir Piercie&mdash;one
of the most delightful creations of Scott&mdash;is a master
also of other arts, knowing how to recite poetry and play
lute and viol-de-gamba. The ‘euphuistic’ conversation of
Sir Piercie is feebly copied by Sir Ezzelin; the epithets
which the former bestows on Halbert Glendinning&mdash;‘Good
goatbearded apostle! Good fellow! Good selvaggio!’&mdash;are
echoed in the terms of address of the latter to an Albigeois
whose prisoner he once happens to be: ‘Good villagio! kind
rustic!’ and so on.&mdash;</p>

<p>A very characteristic figure in the romantic literature of
the time is, finally, Marie de Mortemar. A personage of
this kind had once before, through the influence of Scott,
occupied Maturin’s imagination; the old Irishwoman in
<i>Women</i>, as we have seen, was pronounced to be drawn after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
Meg Merrilies, and the same observation was made by critics<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
about Marie de Mortemar: ‘&mdash;an old woman, who
is a sorceress, a conspirator, a preserver, and a perpetual
meddler; such are the sins for which the maker of Meg
Merrilies has to answer.’ The type certainly was, if not
actually invented, at least made fashionable by Scott. His
old women appear as champions of some great cause which
they with might and main try to advance, or else endeavour
to revenge personal injuries to which they have been subjected
and which have reduced them to their pitiable state.
Marie de Mortemar belongs to the latter class, possessing,
however, all the strength and energy of the former. With
Meg Merrilies she has but little in common, except the miraculous
skill with which she pursues her aim; she guides the
ways of Paladour much as Meg guides young Bertram, never
resting till punishment has reached the guilty. Magdalena
Greame, in <i>The Abbot</i> (1820) has devoted her life to Queen
Mary and the Catholic faith, and as mysteriously and unflinchingly
conducts the adventures of her kinsman Roland,
whom she has chosen to be a promoter of her schemes.
Yet another meddler is Norna in <i>The Pirate</i> (1822). She,
like Marie de Mortemar, has been ill-used in her youth
and partially lost her reason; and although she is not revengeful
and her meddling is only for the good, she has the
same gift of omnipresence and omniscience which appeals
to the superstition of her neighbours and which has been
acquired in a way suggested, perhaps, by the Radcliffe
heroes: ‘It was one branch of various arts by which Norna
endeavoured to maintain her pretensions to supernatural
powers, that she made herself familiarly and practically
acquainted with all the secret passes and recesses, whether
natural or artificial, which she could hear of, whether by
tradition or otherwise, and was, by such knowledge, often
enabled to perform feats which were otherwise unaccountable.’
Marie de Mortemar, it is needless to say, is perfectly
acquainted with the caves and the rocks, the high-ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
and by-ways of all Languedoc.&mdash;The other variation of
this character is personified by Ulrica in <i>Ivanhoe</i>: a deeply-wronged
woman, a prisoner, who once ‘was free, was happy,
was honoured, loved, and was beloved’ while yet being
‘the daughter of the noble Thane of Torquilstone, before
whose frown a thousand vassals trembled’&mdash;just as her
counterpart in <i>The Albigenses</i> was ‘a noble, beautiful lady,
heiress of Mortemar.’ As the prototype of Ulrica we may
perhaps regard Queen Margaret in Shakespeare’s <i>Richard
III</i>, who walks about, a ghost of her former self,
cursing the murderer of her son and her husband:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Like Queen Margaret, Ulrica is unable actively to work
for the destruction of her malefactor, having to content
herself with ineffective wailings and execrations; while
Marie de Mortemar&mdash;who also most terribly curses her
oppressors&mdash;finds opportunity of ‘meddling’ as much as
she pleases. Yet Ulrica, by accident, succeeds in setting
fire to the magazine of fuel beneath the castle of Reginald
Front-de-Boef and thus has, like Marie de Mortemar, the
satisfaction of witnessing the dying agonies of her enemy.
Their gloomy triumph is the same; Ulrica cries to the perishing
Reginald: ‘Summon thy vassals around thee, doom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
them that loiter to the scourge and the dungeon&mdash;But
know, mighty chief &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; thou shalt have neither answer,
nor aid, nor obedience at their hands.’ Marie de Mortemar
exults at the death-scene of the bishop of Toulouse: ‘Hark &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; hark
to thy knell. Thine enemies are around thee&mdash;thine
allies in blood and crime are perishing. Chain
me to the stake: burn me an’ ye will; but, ere I am in
ashes, thou wilt be in flames.’ The unhappy women willingly
perish themselves at the moment their vengeance is
fulfilled.</p>

<p>The picture drawn of the life and manners of the Albigenses
is, in some essentials, inspired by the descriptions
of the Covenanters in <i>Old Mortality</i>&mdash;a circumstance which,
besides being pointed out by critics both contemporary
and modern,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> was admitted by Maturin himself; he observes,
when introducing the sect for the first time: ‘It is &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; a
curious, but indisputable matter of fact, that
the majority of them were as tenacious of certain texts and
terms of the Old Testament, as their legitimate descendants,
the English Puritans, were some centuries later; and that,
like them, they assumed Jewish names, fought with Jewish
obduracy, and felt with Jewish hostility, even towards
those of their community who differed from them in a
penumbra of their creed.’ Hence the speeches and opinions
of Boanerges&mdash;the leader of the sterner Albigenses&mdash;are
the same, only less poignantly expressed, as Balfour’s;
they quote the Old Testament as their chief authority,
evince a mind equally relentless and unforgiving, and Boanerges
rejects the appeals of Pierre to common humanity
on the same arguments which Balfour uses in his dispute
with Morton. The passages treating of the Albigenses are,
however, vividly written and not wholly lacking in originality.
The deacon Mephibosheth has no counterpart in Scott,
and the little love-story of Amand is both natural and skilfully
introduced, while the character of Pierre is entirely
conventional.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>This last romance of Maturin was soon forgotten, nor
was it ever reprinted, notwithstanding the benevolent
critiques.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> What the renumeration amounted to is not
known, but Maturin’s last months were, by all accounts,
about the gloomiest in his existence. Cares and anxieties
had already begun to prey upon his health&mdash;never very
robust&mdash;and the unfavourable circumstances under which
<i>The Albigenses</i> was composed, at the expense of the night’s
rest during a long time, completely broke it down, his pecuniary
difficulties remaining as threatening as ever. There
are, in Mangan’s article, a few recollections relative to
the closing period of Maturin’s life; and although the writer,
no doubt, shares the old tendency of his subject ‘of
darkening the gloomy, and of deepening the sad,’ it is clear
enough that there was, at this time, very little left of the
well-dressed dandy who had once so greatly excelled in quadrille-parties
and private theatricals:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The second time I saw Maturin he had been just officiating, as
on the former occasion, at a funeral. He stalked along York Street
with an abstracted, or rather distracted air, the white scarf and hat-band
which he had received remaining still wreathed round his
beautifully-shaped person, and exhibiting to the gaze of the amused
and amazed pedestrians whom he almost literally <i>encountered</i> in
his path, a boot upon one foot and a shoe on the other. His long
pale, melancholy, Don Quixote, out-of-the-world face would have
inclined you to believe that Dante, Bajazet, and the Cid had risen
together from their sepulchres, and clubbed their features for the
production of an effect. But Maturin’s mind was only fractionally
pourtrayed, so to speak, in his countenance. The great Irishman,
like Hamlet, had that within him which passed show, and escaped
far and away beyond the possibility of expression by the clay lineament.
He bore the ‘thunder-scars’ about him, but they were graven,
not on his brow, but on his heart.</p>

<p>The third and last time that I beheld this marvellous man I remember
well. It was some time before his death, on a balmy
autumn evening, in 1824. He slowly descended the steps of his own
house &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; and took his way in the direction of Whitefriars
Street, into Castle Street, and passed the Royal Exchange into
Dame Street, every second person staring at him and the extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
double-belted and treble-caped rug of an old garment&mdash;neither
coat nor cloak&mdash;which enveloped his person. But here it
was that I, who had tracked the footsteps of the man as his shadow,
discovered that the feeling to which some individuals, rather over
sharp and shrewd, had been pleased to ascribe this ‘affectation of
singularity,’ had no existence in Maturin. For, instead of passing
along Dame Street, where he would have been ‘the observed of all
observers,’ he wended his way along the dark and forlorn locality
of Dame Lane, and having reached the end of this not very classical
thoroughfare, crossed over to Anglesea Street, where I lost sight of
him. Perhaps he went into one of those bibliopolitan establishments
wherewith that Paternoster Row of Dublin then abounded. I never
saw him afterwards.</p>
</div>

<p>In the beginning of October 1824 Maturin was seized
by an acute malady which the physicians, considering his
impaired health in general, apprehended to be mortal. On
the 5:th Sir Charles Morgan wrote to Cyrus Redding:<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear R.&mdash;Poor Maturin is ill, severely ill; we (the Drs.)
have sent him into the country, I fear, to die. Not contented with
drawing the ‘saints’ down upon him, he has attacked the ‘papishes’
and is now in the condition somewhat of a nut between the two
blades of a nutcracker. If the poor fellow should live, and the two
parties abuse him into a good living, there might be some good for
it, for he has a family of fine children. I fear, however, there is little
chance of either.</p>
</div>

<p>These forebodings were, indeed, soon fulfilled: Maturin
died on October 30:th in his home in Dublin whither he,
for some reason or other, had returned from the country.
There was a story afloat of his having caused, or at least
precipitated, his death by some mistake about his medicine;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
however this may have been, it is evident from
the letter of Sir Charles that the case was sufficiently alarming
already some four weeks before.&mdash;The death was briefly
announced by the local papers; in <i>The Morning Star</i> of
Nov. 3 there was this necrology:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In him the poor have lost a kind friend; our religion a firm supporter;
and literature one of its brightest ornaments.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>In the summer of 1825 Walter Scott made his journey
to Ireland, which he had long been planning. He had looked
forward, with pleasure, to the prospect of becoming personally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
acquainted with Maturin, and had intended to
invite the latter to accompany him during the tour. Now
he could only pay a visit to the family,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> for whose profit
he is said to have contemplated a new edition of Maturin’s
works, as well as the publication of some manuscripts found
among his literary remains,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> to which he would have prefixed
a biography of his deceased friend; but his own pecuniary
embarrassments, commencing just at this time, prevented
him from realizing the project&mdash;and Maturin’s
works soon began to fall into oblivion. <i>Montorio</i> was, in
1841, republished by William Hazlitt as vol. I in the <i>Ballantyne’s
Romancists and Novelists Library</i> which he edited;
<i>Bertram</i> appeared in <i>The British Drama</i> in 1865 and in
Dick’s <i>Standard Plays</i> in 1884; and, lastly, <i>Melmoth the
Wanderer</i> was reprinted in 1892, with no very distinct
success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To Charles Robert Maturin’s life and to his works, as
such, the present study must be confined; his influence
on later literature, above all on French romanticism, can
here only be pointed out as a subject not yet exhaustively
inquired into.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The work through which this influence
was exercised is <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>, chiefly, yet not
exclusively, inasmuch as <i>Bertram</i> also was immoderately
admired in France and hailed as one of the foremost productions
of contemporary literature. <i>Melmoth</i>, the great
and concluding outburst of the English school of terror,
stands there as at once its lasting monument and an outlet
through which some of its peculiarities were, directly or
indirectly, revived by the movements succeeding the downfall
of 19:th century naturalism. The place in literary history
of <i>Women</i>, Maturin’s other masterpiece, is more isolated.
So far from belonging to any definite movement of the time
it foreshadows, in a striking manner, the school of Dickens
in its descriptions of middle class life, manners and characters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
while its minute researches in the abysses of the
human heart anticipate the analytic fiction of the very
latest periods. In Maturin’s production <i>Women</i> is of an
importance equal to that of <i>Melmoth</i>, nor is his literary
physiognomy complete if <i>The Milesian Chief</i> is not remembered
for its purely romantic qualities and its patriotic
enthusiasm. These three works, which are Maturin’s best,
afford ample illustration of the versatility of his genius,
which versatility itself is an exponent of the spirit of freedom
and experiment prevailing during the romantic revival.
What they all have in common is the style of writing, the
art of dealing with language as the sculptor deals with clay.
Maturin’s part in the renewal of the imaginative English
prose has been asserted by the latest authorities,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and
the excellence of his style doubtless did much to obtain
for him the appreciation of his brothers in the trade. It
was the custom of contemporary reviewers to speak of
Maturin’s novels as something particularly suited to the
frequenters of circulating libraries, and it is true that with
the large bulk of respectable, educated readers Maturin
never was very popular; but then there was a small fraction
of the public whose taste, in this respect, closely coincided
with that of the former: most of those writers, great or
small, whom Maturin admired, eagerly repaid the compliment.
Lewis used to revel in the gloomy pages of <i>Montorio</i><a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
and was, as has been seen, pleased even with <i>Manuel</i>.
Godwin, to whom so many of Maturin’s writings are indebted,
is recorded<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> to have uttered: ‘if there be any
writer of the present day, to whose burial-place I should
wish to make a pilgrimage, that writer is Maturin.’ <i>The
Confessions of a Justified Sinner</i> (1824) of James Hogg&mdash;one
of the favourite poets of Maturin&mdash;seems to be
not uninfluenced by <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>. The high opinion
which Scott and Byron entertained of Maturin has
more than once appeared in the foregoing pages&mdash;and
among later romancists who are known to have delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
in the adventures of the Wanderer, or upon whose work
he has even left an unmistakable print, we find names such
as Balzac, Hugo, De Vigny, Baudelaire, Villiers de l’Isle-Adam,
Poe, Thackeray, Rossetti, Stevenson, Oscar Wilde.
Thus, if Maturin is not always&mdash;as he would deserve to
be&mdash;remembered on his own account, he is at least mentioned
in connection with, as he was acknowledged by,
a great many of those writers who unquestionably form
the ‘upper ten’ in the world of 19:th century letters.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> In all notes and biographies the year of Maturin’s birth is given
as 1782, which is probably founded upon an indirect statement
made by himself in the preface to his first romance <i>Montorio</i>,
dated December 15, 1806, where he says that he is twenty-four
years of age. Yet in the Matriculation Book of Trinity
College, as may still be seen, his entrance is marked in 1795
and his age given as fifteen, whence it would appear that he
was born in 1780. It has also been communicated to me that
in a pedigree of the family, issued by Sir William Betham,
Ulster King-at-Arms, in 1845, it is stated that C. R. M. was
born in 1780.</p>

had two brothers: William and Henry, and three sisters: Fidelia,
Emma, and Alicia.&mdash;It is said in an article in <i>Douglas
Jerrold’s Shilling Magazine</i> (1846, vol. III p. 125), with reference
to Maturin’s early love of the stage, that ‘no similar abilities,
however, were shown by his brothers, whose lots in life were
very different;’ whereas the writer in the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>
1827, who also claims to have been an intimate friend of
Charles Robert Maturin, maintains that the latter was the
‘only child of many who lived beyond the term of boyhood’&mdash;which
goes to show that the information furnished by the
Magazines is, in general, to be taken with some reserve.</p>

induced Maturin to lend his name to it by giving him the profit

and his correspondence were destroyed by his son, the
Rev. William Maturin, who disapproved of his father’s connection
with the stage. This story has, as far as I know, never
been definitely proved; it will be remembered that the writer
in the <i>Irish Quarterly Review</i> was, in 1852, in a position to
communicate several extracts from <i>The Siege of Salerno</i>, which
he states to have been found among the manuscripts in question.
That Maturin’s correspondence contained, as has sometimes
been alleged, letters from Goethe and Balzac, I think
very unlikely.&mdash;Another son, Edward Maturin, emigrated to
America and subsequently published several romances both
in prose and verse, which, however, do not evince any traces
of his father’s genius.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_181" href="#FNanchor_181" class="label">[181]</a> Maturin’s influence in France has been treated of in Charles
Bonnier, <i>Milieux d’Art</i>, Liverpool 1910. This privately printed
book I know only from a reference in Elton I p. 438. The
points of contact between Balzac and Maturin are briefly
mentioned in J. H. Retinger, <i>Le conte fantastique dans le romantisme
français</i>, Paris 1909.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
